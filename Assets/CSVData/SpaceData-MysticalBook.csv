JD-BH,MB_01,Taj Mahal that took 2 years to make,,"Translation:

Rajasthan Government
District Level Handicrafts Competition
Year 2002-2003

Respected Jakir Hussain,
S/o Abdul Siar,
Is awarded the first prize for his distinguished expertise in the Taj Mahal art, under the District Level Handicrafts Competition.

Signed,
District Collector
Jodhpur

A product of Jakir Hussain’s artistic talent, vision, and, skill – this Taj Mahal model is an exquisitely handcrafted piece carved from Bone & Horn. This masterpiece showcased Hussain’s exceptional capability and artistic skill in the art-form, leading him to win the handicraft district award for the same in 2002. The model does not have a price tag, for its enamoured beauty stands solely for the eyes of its spectators. 

The laborious process took the master artisan 2 entire years to finish. The model uses the popular yet painstaking style of bone-inlay: with each intricately carved bone piece made to fit into the mouldings on the wooden base. The model stands at around 36x36 inches and carries a weight of about 25 kgs. The replica is gilded with colourful traditional motifs such as the pietra dura, engraved with natural forms, motifs, and miniature human forms around the structure."
JD-BH,MB_02,Art Influences on the craft,,"Bone and horn craftsmanship has existed in India for over 4000 years and thus carries within it a rich history. Influences in the designs can be seen from nature, Rajasthani & Mughal miniature art, mythological characters and folklores of the state. Floral motifs, animals, traditional ornamentation, mosaic designs, and geometric patterns are abundant. Western influences on the artform can also be seen in the abstract patterns but are supplemented with a traditional touch. Common objects within the Jodhpur cluster include various boxes, jewellery, trays, and furniture.

The uniqueness of the products is attributed to the individual artisan and the centuries long history of the artform. "
JD-BH,MB_03,Next step in business,,"The importance given to refinement and innovation in craft is essential. Also essential is to retain the craft legacy and generate economic employment within the cluster in order to ensure its continuity. Laxmi Crafts, led by Mr. Kamal Kishor Soni, took one such step through starting the export of their own goods. Granted by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry in 2012, the organization was issued the Importer-Exporter Code which enables the artisan to directly engage with the global market.

With his wide range of products such as jewellery, bags, and decorative household items that meet the demands of a variety of consumers, Mr. Soni has utilized his skill and vision to reach a much wider consumer base."
JD-BH,MB_04,A sustainable craft,,"Upcycling might seem like a recent trend, however the Bone and Horn artistry has been an upcycling industry ever since its inception. The raw material sourced for the craft is procured from the bones of naturally deceased animals that come from a government run agency or legal slaughterhouse in regions of Uttar Pradesh. In the most sustainable fashion, the craft is curated from ""waste"" leftover in nature. Additionally, they do not contribute to the sizeable increase in non-renewable waste landfills, due to their inherent biodegradable quality. 
Bone, in itself, is a material which is not susceptible to rotting or other issues that might come with organic substances, and thus ensures the final products are both durable and eco-friendly."
JD-BH,MB_05,A labour of love,,"An exquisitely handcrafted piece, this centre table is a result of bone and horn artisan, Mr. Jakir Hussain's vision and hard-work. It was created between 2019-2021 during the COVID lockdown. The exquisite table is adorned with boards of ancient gams such as Chess and Pacchisi and comes with in-built drawers that house each game. The games are fully playable with all elements included.
While usually colour-work in bone and horn is done with a single colour as a time, in this table Mr. Hussain painstakingly filled each nook & corner with a different hue.

The table weighs a whooping 100 kgs and is 54 inches in length and 34 inches in width. It is made using bone as the primary material with wood as the secondary. A pale yellow and gold base enhanced with a multiplicity of colours, the table is engraved throughout and also showcases a of miniature paintings. It is an exclusive piece that will not be put up for sale. The craftsman would prefer it to be showcased in a museum to put the intricate beauty on display for public viewing. However in commercial value, the table would cost no less than 5 lakhs rupees."
JD-BH,MB_06,Raw Materials,,"The raw materials used in the process can be traced back to the 1st century BCE, patronized by wealthy ruling authorities. Bone and horn craftsmanship is unique in its ways of procurement as well as its usage in the craft. These mini pieces of gems are procured in Jodhpur from Moradabad, Uttar Pradesh- Sambal and Barabanki, some parts of Kolkata and Udaipur. They come from the bones of naturally deceased animals – no animals are harmed in the process. The environment friendly industry flourishes in Sambhal, wherein the entire village has become specialised in the art of cleaning and cutting the bones. "
JD-BH,MB_07,A canvas of colours,,"These vases, provide a glimpse into the hue of colours used throughout the bone and horn cluster in Jodhpur. Hand-painting is prevalent across the industry and some commonly seen influences include floral & animal motifs and Rajasthani style miniatures. The colours mostly noticed are yellow, green, red, white and blue, with a recent increase popularity of black & white geometric designs. 

Categorized as vintage in the markets, bone and horn products have retained their authenticity and culture throughout their art. "
JD-BH,MB_08,User centric design,,"These bracelets of pure bone, are a signature variety of jewellery crafted by Mr. Kamal Kishor Soni. Made of brass and inlaid stone work, these statement pieces take about 20 days to be crafted and produced as finished products. Although mostly white, they are available in multiple colours and are also often finished with splash of rainbow over the white. Weighing not more than 100 gms and about 0.5 inches in width, the bangles and bracelets come in a variety of sizes. 

Once coloured, many of them are hand-painted with miniature floral & nature-inspired motifs or references from the Rajasthani school of miniature paintings. These bracelets were an innovation done by Mr. Soni as he assessed the market feedback from his various exhibitions. "
JD-BH,MB_09,Representation of Rajasthan's heritage,,"As a representative of Rajasthan’s cultural heritage, the craft of bone and horn is a standout example of workmanship, design influence and the craft material as well as the technique used. The craft has been indigenously developed and evolved through the years of the changing socio-political and cultural landscape of the state. 
This artefact crafted by Rahmat Ali Sindhi is a traditional toy, Ambavadi, most often an elephant with a palanquin. It is a sustainable gift item that can also be used as a home decor piece. Also with the royal touch, this toy is a symbol of Rajasthan's regal heritage. Alongside, the intricate floral motifs remind one of the lavish gardens of the forts of Rajasthan. Weighing approximately 3 kgs, this pure bone artefact is a treasure trove for any craft enthusiast. "
JD-BH,MB_10,Luxury to utility,,"While bone and horn is primarily considered a medium for luxury and aesthetically appealing products, they have recently also been put into use of making utilitarian products, such as this pencil box. A daily use item, by any student, can be also used as a cutlery box, a jewellery throve or a home décor product. The surreal colour combination of white and teal gives a radiant look to the piece. With floral motifs, the piece is further enhanced as an enchanted forest.
This product by Imammudin comes in an array of variations, with similar textures, colours and shapes. The best part however is the fact that the usage of each of these multipurpose boxes can be defined by the consumer themselves. Adding an ethnic touch to the daily use items, Imammudin has been trying to bring his craft to the lives of the ordinary from its initial royal patronage and usage. "
JD-LM,MB_01,Kashidakaari,,"The mojaris of Jodhpur are known for their emauculate designing and workmanship, derived majorly from the hand-done stitching on the upper part of the mojari. Once the sole and upper is stitched together, the upper is embroidered by women, skilled in the art. Intricate needle work, all done by hand, lends the method its literal name, kashidakaari. This ancient needle and threadwork technique emerges from the Sindh plateau, now widely practiced by several communities in Kashmir on pashminas and in Rajasthan on mojaris. The ornamentation owes its beauty to the quality of threads during the needlework, indigenously silk and zari. Nowadays, however, for the sake of availability and affordability, coloured cotton threads are also brought into use. Often along with needle stitching, applique designs using scrapped pieces of cloth and bead embroidery are complimentary adornments. The kashidakaari on mojaris is not restricted to the upper part of the mojari. Piping on the edges using coloured threads, is a decorative as well as functional element that lends additional comfort to the footwear. Ironically, the process of this intrciate needlework is not as intricate as the designs it produces. The needle used in the process is usually a self-made repurposed umbrella rib, and thread easily available in the local markets of Jodhpur. Predominantly done and passed on by the women of the family, kashidakaari is a work of accurate craftsmanship and creative intellect. The designs used in the embroidery carry influences from the nature and have been named differently for theri unique feature and idetification. Some of these motifs named amar bel, fulpatti, jaadkewaale, zardozi, zari, leheriya, star, and influences from traditional jewellery are makers favourites."
JD-LM,MB_02,Innovation in production,,"The art of leather mojari making and social habit of wearing one, dates back to the medieval times. However, with time there has been a significant need for change in the way the footwear is made, congruent to the change in how the footwear is worn. Hence, innovations in the field are not just inevitable but also essential. Introduction of machinery to reduce the time taken to cut larger chunks of leather into smaller sizeable pieces, is one of them. Other innovations include changes in designs, inclusion of block printing patterns and less intricate work that also increase the comfort and longevity of these mojaris. The wearability quotient of the mojaris has also increased over the years owing to the innovations in the flexibility of the sole, given that different leathers are used for different parts of the mojari. Innovations in terms of the embroidery designs and their intricacy is another marker of transition. Softer designs have made their mark in the market in recent times. Other means of innovating and experimenting are born of the artisan’s own creativity and intellect, for market space optimization and consumer expansion."
JD-LM,MB_03,Women Labour,,"A major chunk of the mojari industry is comprised by women, engaged in small scale and cottage industries. These women, are mostly outsourced and work as daily labourers for a wholesaler. Unemployed and underemployed women have been especially benefitted from this strategy, alongwith ensuring cost cutting for a lot of producers. These women who work in the comfort of their own homes as daily wage artisans are skilled in embroidery work. For each piece that they embroider, a fixed price is given to them. While the raw material and post embroidery maufacturing labor is provided by the wholesaler, the intervention of these women is integral to the mojari making process as their skill is unique to them. Now remaining a handful, women who have the know-how of kashidakaari, the indigenous embroidery and its patterns are declining in numbers. Reliance on mechanised means and geometric patterns has multiplied the value of these small scale women workers and their skill-set."
JD-LM,MB_04,Social significance of each embroidery,,"Of the embroideries that have become famous over the years of the evolution of the craft, most of them carry a social significance and owe their existence to a cultural symbol. Kashidakari designs like the amar bel and zardozi have been markers of social distinction. Additionally, the material used of for these designs used to be different for each community as a symbol of their social identity. Most of the floral motifs in green and yellow are typical to Jodhpur, but relatively newer alongwith inspirations from Madhubani and Pattachitra paintings from other regions. The embroidery however isnt just restricted to the upper of the mojari, but also displays on the sole. The soles earlier had specific patterns that got engraved on sand and were useful in marking social territories. These mechanisms of social distinctions evolved through the years and the patterns became universally viable."
JD-LM,MB_05,Communities involved,,"The Jingar craft community is diverse and holistic in nature. The Jingars initially migrated from the Sindh region to various parts of the wedtern states of India, bringing with them a tightly knit tradition of leather work. Currently, several members of the community are into the leather mojari business who associate themselves to the legacy of makers of leather reigns, saddles, and sword sheaths. Post the medieval era, most of the workers moved to products like mojari and other leather goods. Jingars are however, not the only ones involved in the craft. Historically, the Meghwals, Regars and Jingars functioned in cohesion in a healthy inter-communal exchange to produce mojaris. While the Regars prepared the leather, the Meghwals did further preparation and finishing and the Jingars, bought the prepared leather from the Regars and Meghwals to make the final mojari. Through the years the Jingar community continued its practice to make a business out of it. As of today, the workers engaged with the Jingars are void of any communal baggages and pratice the craft out of pure artisanal capability and intrigue."
JD-LM,MB_06,Mechanical Innovation,,"The leather mojari artisans are rooted to their ways and mechacnisms for a larger chunk of manufacturing and production of the mojaris. They have been loyal to their age old practices, including their tools and process of moajri making. However, with new requirements and increasing demands, they have had to look for viable tactics to increase production and stay cost efficient. Hence in the recent past, alongwith the inidgenous tools of rapi, naula, humba and katani, the artisans have brought into function mechanised means to cut the larger chunks of leather into smaller pieces. The adhesive agent, earlier a natural mixture of flours has been replaced by copper sulphate and even fevicol, to increase the durability of the footwear. For most of the process self-made tools are used, but owing to the physical strength that they demand from the artisan, a quick alternative to switch to automated machinery seems the way forward."
JD-LM,MB_07,9 Feet mojari,,"Mohan Lal Gujjar, a leather mojari artisan from Jodhpur is widely recognized for his skill set and the legacy that he carries in terms of traditional craftsmanship and designs. He is attributed to have kept the indigenous patterns alive even under the pressures of large scale manufacturing. One of his most talked about creations is a 9 feet mojari that is purely handcrafted and embroidered in patterns of Rajasthani textures. The Kashidakaari or embroidery done on the mojari is floral and is a display of the double thread use technique. Mohan Lal ji takes pride in his creation, that was also displayed as a centre piece in the JCKIC Exhibition at IIT Jodhpur. Post the success of this display, the artwork is being replicated in a 11 feet structure, a larger and grander piece of craftsmanship."
JD-LM,MB_08,Challenges in production,,"Leather as a raw material has remained a social taboo ever since its inception. However with the awareness of it being derived from carcasses of dead animals, it has managed to remain viable in domestic as well as international markets. However, leather is subjected to some cultural and religious prohibition. Though, it is not the only challenge that the material faces. Leather does not dry easily, especially during monsoons;when also the sale is low. The sale skyrockets during the festive and wedding season,owing to the marketability of the product and its widespread demand during the time. The most common and widely recognized challenge however remains the low availability of artisans with the know-how of the craft. In case of embroidery and the women labor attached to it, the numbers are constantly decreasing and have seen a major dip in the recent past. Mechanisation is incapable of yielding the same results as handcrafted work, but despite that the current artisans view that as the only viable option."
JD-LM,MB_09,Product Diversification,,"As the demand of leather mojari fluctuates and remains inconsistent, the artisans aim to bring their skills into use in a variety of other products too. Given the fact that the raw material and craftsmanship remains the same, the ability to diversify products enables the artisans to venture into other markets alos. In an effort to do so, the mojari artisans have started to produce leather bags including slings, wallets and laptop carry-ons too. Appealing to the larger masses, and catering to a much wider demographic the diversification strengthens the market visibility of each artisan alongwith serving an individual space for professional growth. Apart from handbags, there are efforts to create other daily use items including small knick knacks like keychains, belts, wallets and other products that can be prepared using leather and be sold as easy revenue items."
JD-LM,MB_10,Vegan Mojaris,,"The raw material of leather has been often questioned, socially and culturally. With efforts to find similar alternatives for leather has been a long search and a variety of raw materials have been introduced in the process. Some of them being, PU leather, canvas and even cloth. However the recent trend among the leather mojari artisans of Jodhpur, popularly known as vegan leather, is dominated by PU material. With easily available and comparatively comfortable rubber soles and textures that look like leather, the material provides opportunities to experiment with design and shapes. In the case of vegan leather, the traditional kashidakaari designs have been replaced with block printed cloth that are outsourced from a different set of artisans in the locality. This method opens avenues for a multiple array of colours and designs and from the point of view of the producer, makes the process less tedious and more cost effective."
JD-SD,MB_01,Product Diversification,,"The common threat to durrys of Salawas has been their large size and potential higher costs. While increase in the production and subsequent selling cost is inevitable, to keep themselves relevant in the market, weavers have resorted to diversification in their product range. Most of the weavers have been able to find alternatives for the challenges faced in producing and creating a market for the conventional durrys. One such solution is the manufacturing of smaller durrys as per the customer’ interest and viability. They have also begun venturing into products other than durrys, including table mats and table runners. Bags are another product variation that create a market and can also enter a new competitive industry. They are experimenting with different sizes and styles of bags like sling bags, laptop and office bags and look forward to introduce more stitched products soon. This product diversification has opened awareness about the making of Salawas durries among new customers which has increased the use of carpets along with demand of newer product variants made using similar techniques and raw materials.
"
JD-SD,MB_02,Salawas village,,"In Jodhpur, about 22 kms away from the city centre, lies a village Salawas, from which the durry derives its name and quality. Their tools are simple merely a loom and shuffle, yarn and a pick are used to create perfection in the form of Salawas Durries.
A common cooperative, Salawas Durry Udhyog continues to follow the traditional method of durry weaving, adapted to modern usage, and each Durry is going through the perfect hands. The principle weavers have participated in major national workshops and fairs, and have won many laurels. Salawas carved out an identity for itself 32 years ago when Shyam Ahuja started with 100 villagers and soon the entire village knew the technique of weaving durries with contemporary designs.
"
JD-SD,MB_03,Continuing legacies,,"The Chippa community of Sindh worked as farmers, weavers, printers and dyers to make ends meet. Water shortages led to migration and the search for new opportunities of livelihood. Farming in this region was seasonal and completely rain fed. Weaving was an activity they were familiar with and there was a demand from the local community and the Royalty for the Dhurries and Shawls. For a lot of families in Salawas, their ancestors were employed by the ruling families and made durrys only for them. The entire family was supported by the ruling classes, they even paid for weddings and funerals. The weaver families believe that they are descendents of the Khatri community and had knowledge of all processes related to fabrics, which facilitated their weaving journey. Initially there was a need for printers and so they became Chippa’s and over 300 years they moved to weaving durrys as there was a bigger market for it. 
"
JD-SD,MB_04,Innovation in designs,,"The original reference to the use of durries is related to the paintings made on floors in India. It is believed that certain symbols or designs were made on the floor in the Hindu and Tribal cultures using various mediums to ward off evil and negative energies from the house. These designs are still popular as rangolis, kolams, and mandanas. The durries were an updated version of these designs made using different materials from camel, and goat hair to cotton and jute thread today. The oldest durry is displayed in the British Museum which belongs to the era of 1st century to 3rd century AD according to carbon dating. The main designs and patterns seen in the durries are mostly geometric. Like the many crafts we see the craftsmen of durry making took inspiration from the flora and fauna around them. The motifs in the durries ranged from the Mandana, flowers, leaves, nature elements, tree of life, geometric elements, and much more. The craftsmen have been experimenting with more and more designs and color schemes too. 
"
JD-SD,MB_05,Threads used,,"These durrys were earlier woven with coarse and thik camel, goat and sheep hair and were called as Jhad Patti. They were heavier and thicker than the modern versions of durries, as today we see the durries are made with cotton and jute threads. The cotton and jute threads are thinner than the camel,goat and sheep hair. They are thinner and lighter in weight. This new raw material has encouraged the craftsmen to introduce new products in various sizes and styles as the cost of production is slightly lower as compared to the older raw material. The cotton and jute material gives flexibility to make smaller products like table mats, table runners and smaller durries for multiple use. These can also be stitched in different ways so the craftsmen have started to make sticthed and finished products like bags. 
"
JD-SD,MB_06,Setting up the loom,,"In earlier times, weavers used to work on pit looms that were very large. However, to opt for a more convenient set-up, weavers have now shifted to  a frame loom called Patth and use a Panja or claw tool . Standing looms called Khari have become rare. Depending on the size of the durry they use different kinds of looms. The pit looms are still used for making large sized dhurries. In the past the looms were manipulated using stones and logs – now they have innovated using screws and bolts. The mechanism is now easier, simpler, and quicker to put together. Apart from saving time, they have also reduced the efficiency required. 
"
JD-SD,MB_07,Market transformations,,"Around 100 years back most of the craftsmen wove the durries and kept them at their homes as the business happened from homes. The customers belonged to different communities residing in the region. These communities included the Rabaris, the Rajputs, the Chaudaris, the Jats, and many others. It is said that the Rabaris who belong to the pastoralists community came to the weavers with handspun yarn and got their durries weaved from them and paid them the weaving charges. Today these local communities however do not wish to buy and use durries. So the demand in local markets of  Salawas or Jodhpur is less and limited and caters to only the tourist or people who are aware of this craft and interested in buying handmade handwoven durries. 
The craftsmen however realized that the demand for handmade crafts is more in the markets outside, so they started selling the durries and other products in exhibitions and other markets. The craftsmen also export the durries to different countries. Today they are associated with different organizations like Banglanatak dot com, and UNESCO which help them propagate their business. They also look forward to expanding online markets and adopting digital technology in different ways to expand their business.
"
JD-SD,MB_08,Involvement of women,,"Most of the weavers in Salawas worked as family units, without any gender distinction in work. This included women of all ages to be a part of the process. Even today, several artisans are working together with their mothers, from whom they had learnt the craft initially. The younger women of the house are important point of contacts for making small balls of yarns that are ultimately used in the weft. The next generation females including the grand-daughters in a few families have been keenly learning the craft along with pursuing their education. These women have steerheaded the business, and kept the craft alive even in times when the men went out of their way to find alternative income sources. It is through them that the oral traditionals and mechanical knowledge has passed down from generation to generation.
"
JD-SD,MB_09,Washing the durry,,"The prepared durrys are sent to the washing line post the final check. It is however not an essential requirement for their sale. But in case of consumer demand, the durrys are washed in an open space with plain water and brushed over. In few cases a strong stone wash technique is applied on them. It is ideally done to straighten the threads of the freshly made durry and remove any external dust accumulated during the process of weaving, as the loom is generally set in an open space.
"
JD-SD,MB_10,Use of charkha,,"While most of the artisans today prefer purchasing the dyed yarn directly from large scale manufacturers, there are a few artisans like Malaram Mundel Ji, who still believes in making his own yarn from fibre. Using the age old tradition of weaving on a charkha, Malaram Ji and his son together have revived the process their forefathers used. Following this practice, they not just reduce their production costs and dependencies, but also increase their credibility of authenticity. 
"
JD-TD,MB_01,Designing techniques,,"Tie and dye involves many steps that helps in achieving a vibrant and colorful pattern on the fabric along with the basic and unavoidable step of tying the fabric in different ways and then dyeing them in varied colorful dye baths.The fabrics used range from cotton, silk, georgette, chiffon, and other synthetic fabrics depending on the customer demand and the final use. For making Bandhani/ Bandhej products these fabrics first get the desired design stamped on it (a process called chapai), then according the designs the knots are pinched and tied, further ready to be washed in clean water and then dyed, submerged and redyed in the colored water.
While Leheriya involves the twisting,folding and tying of fabric in a particular way to achieve horizontal, vertical, diagonal or criss cross lined pattern on the fabrics
"
JD-TD,MB_02,Communities involved,,"Tie and dye has been associated with different communities that not only practise this craft but also people who use the products made from this craft process. Rangrez, Chhipa, Chadua, and Neelgar communities are involved in the making process of the Bandhej products. While we also find a social and cultural association with the motifs and pattern on the clothes designed. 
These designs were customised separately for different people, were identity markers for some and passed their own stories down too. Chundaris now popular as dupattas with green boxes were worn only by the Rajputs. Meanwhile  there was a five colored turban called a panchranga safa was exclusively worn by the Champawat Rajputs, while today we see almost everyone wearing it on special occasions. These stories and utility of the customised designed bandhej products from the past remain with the older generation people of the craft community, in museums and or documented in books,vidoes or pictures with a welcoming approach to new designs, new stories and new uses of the craft.
"
JD-TD,MB_03,Participation of women,,"The women from the communities who are associated with tie and dye craft have been a part of the craft process in some or the other way. The women from the Jodhpur tie and dye craft cluster are mostly involved in the tying process of the fabric preceding the dyeing of the fabric. 
The women mostly work from home so they have the fabric with preparation delivered at home and after they finish the tying process it is sent to the workshops for dyeing. At some well to do households of the craft cluster the women look after the house and do not participate in business. 

"
JD-TD,MB_04,Fierce competition,,"Every craft faces challenges along its journey of growth and evolution. Tie and dye as a craft has been and is going through some ups and downs. Handmade craft and textile have a special recognition and demand in the markets, specially the markets outside India. The craftsmen in Jodhpur are now well aware about the same and slowly wish to fulfill needs of the market. 
Mohd. Tasleem, one of the craftsmen hence says, ‘We know that there is always going to be ample demand for the craft, however today we have more and more people who are practising this craft hence there is a competition among us’. So we see that there are migrants who are learning about the craft and starting their businesses thus creating a more competitive market which reduces the wages that the craftsmen get. Because of which chance of using cheaper raw material which give cheaper final products is seen. There is a wave of use of synthetic fabrics and chemical dyes in the market which may be harmful for in the long run.
"
JD-TD,MB_05,Learning within the community,,"The role as a community is very significant in most of the living heritages, craftsmanship being one. The Rangrez, Chauda, Chippa and the Neelgar communities have been working together for several generations to keep the craft of tie and dye in practise till day.  
The production process of tie and dye involves multiple steps and techniques. Earlier particular community specialised in a particular technique and only they use to do that part of the process further passing to the next community. For example, the Vankars(weavers) would weave the fabric followed by the Rangrez or Chauda community who would either buy this weaved fabric for dyeing or would dye the yarn used for weaving and share with the weavers. The fabric was washed, cleaned, stamped, tied and dyed and sold in markets further to other community people. If the fabric was to be dyed in shades on Indigo the Neelgars used to buy the fabric and work with it.  While today each and every community performs all steps as they have more number of people who are working and they wish to be self sufficient in the business. While doing this too there is an exchange between the communities about the new products to be used, raw material, processes and also the difficulties they face.
"
JD-TD,MB_06,Shift in market,,"Change is the only constant. Appropriately seen as the crafts of Jodhpur adapt and grow with times. The emphasis on the fact that how the local communities of Rajasthan from the royals to the commoners have been using tie and dyed products has already been discussed earlier. The use from day to day wear has also seen a shift to specific festival or celebrations. 
The customers today are dominantly people from outside the state of Rajasthan including tourists, people who love and admire handmade crafts and people who reside outside India as the craft products are being exported to places. Younger generation of the craftsmen is educated and has more exposure with technology so they are also catering to large audience not only through the local markets but also by selling in fairs, exhibitions, global markets and online platforms. Since the people come from various demographics the craftsmen have also made a change in their approach and they have started producing products in a huge variety. 
"
JD-TD,MB_07,Product Diversification,,"We have evidently seen how the chundaris(duppatas), turbans, sarees, lehengas and blouses were the dominant products in the markets over the many generations. These were the traditional outfits of the people from Rajasthan and hence the craftsmen of the tie and dye community also mostly produced them in bulk.
Today we see a shift in the approach, along with these traditional outfits there are a range of products from dupattas, stoles, scarfs, bandanas, single and double bedsheets, pillows, sarees, suits, tops, dresses and many more. The younger generation in the craftsmen community is educated and we also see many craftsmen becoming designers so they understand the market better and help bringing more suggestions to the table further expanding the family legacy and craftsmanship in multiple directions.
"
JD-TD,MB_08,Legacies and beyond,,"You would find very rare craft practices that do not have their stories and association of the legacies of how the craftsmen have acquired the skills and knowledge from their ancestors over the years. And a famous tag line that Indian craftsmen love to say “Peedihyo se chale aa raha hai”, the craft has been practised from several generations in our family.
Tie and dye in Jodhpur has been here for almost more than 5000 years and still continues to prosper as the community practices the craft with love and passion while making their livelihood turning them into businesses. Each and every craftsman joyfully narrates with pride how they have been trained by their grandparents, parents, or relatives and how today they share their legacy with their family and continue pratcising the craft.

"
JD-TD,MB_09,Evolution of process,,"The shift from 100 % manual processes to adapting to partial technology for making these exclusive hand made pieces has been visible in the tie and dye craft processes. In today’s times where the craftsmen are looking to scale up their businesses it becomes very important to adapt to technology while keeping in mind that the authentic processes are not interferred with. 
The craftsmen of Jodhpur have incorporated some machines to speed the process of the craft. Like we see that there are drying machines used to dry large stock of clothes in one go. There is a distinct growth seen as we see the craftsmen talking about dyeing in bulk, dyeing almost 400 pieces of duppatta in one go ot 100 sarees at a time. 
"
JD-TD,MB_10,Handmade will stay,,"Each and every handmade product is unique and always owns a reflection of the identity of the artisan who makes it. The disticnt identity of the product gives has a sentimental value attached to it which is felt by the maker and user .
