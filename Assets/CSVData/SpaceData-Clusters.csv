There is archaeological evidence of artefacts made from bone and horn in Indus Valley, these include decorative and utility items like combs, knives and other tools. So though the bone and horn carving in India though dates back to the pre-historic times, it gained its momentum and wide-scale use post the ban on usage of ivory.
