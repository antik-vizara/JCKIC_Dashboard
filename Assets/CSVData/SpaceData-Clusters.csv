JD-BH,Bone and Horn,7,"There is a rich history of working with bone and horn in India. Bone and horn have been used in India for over 4000 years to make utility items and decorative artefacts. There is archaeological evidence of artefacts made from bone and horn in Indus Valley, these include decorative and utility items like combs, knives and other tools. So though the bone and horn carving in India though dates back to the pre-historic times, it gained its momentum and wide-scale use post the ban on usage of ivory. Bone and horn craft as seen today in Jodhpur, parts of Uttar Pradesh, Kolkata, and Hyderabad is a remnant of the ancient craft, endangered to say the least. 
The cluster of artisans in Jodhpur is a set of first and second generation of artists,  include those that have trained under the ivory master craftsman, wood carvers, inlay workers and metal workers. Different kinds of products are made depending on the skill set of the artisans and customer needs. The products range from delicately hand carved figures that are reminiscent of ivory craft to inlay work on a wide range of wooden items like jewellery boxes to chairs and tables.
The cluster as a whole produces a multitude of products ranging from jewellery, furniture, home decor items, and uniquely curated animal and natural figurines, influenced from Rajasthani and Mughal miniature art.",Inception of the art,"After the ban on the sale of ivory in 1987, the craftsmen working with ivory moved to the bone and horn material. The craft of bone and horn flourished in Rajasthan and in Jodhpur in particular because of the abundance of artisans and raw material. The present day bone and horn artisans are a mix of artisans from different crafts and communities.",Sustainability,"Handcrafted bone and horn artefacts are sustainable on many levels, with the entire process is labour intensive and eco-friendly. The industry has the potential to meet all three main pillars of sustainable development: Economic growth; Environmental Protection and Social Equity. Additionally, the raw material is procured from the bodies of dead animals and is done in an ethical and the cluster contributes to the recycling, reusing, and reducing of waste material.",Bone Inlay Work,"Jodhpur, dur to their need for lavishness developed the art of inlay. One style that emerges is the bone inlay style, wherein the shards of bone are extracted from camels of the region that die of natural causes, as the horn, ivory and other materials became largely unethical to use, this one ethical medium continued, with no loss of aesthetic."
JD-LM,Leather Mojari,5,"Craft as a form of socio-cultural expression is best expressed through the making of a leather mojari. A utilitarian product that has gained the currency of a craft item and carries a legacy of a generation of producers and consumers, the Indian mojari stands for the needs and cultural affinity of its wearers. While mojaris are widely produced and worn in Sindh and Punjab in both India and Pakistan, and parts of Gujarat and Rajsthan, they carry a different social significance for each region and community that they are a part of. These regional variations are a heavy influence on not just the community involved in the artform but also on the variety and trajectory of each footwear. In Jodhpur, Rajasthan, the Jingar community is involved in the mojari making business. It derives its name from the word jinn that itself means saddle, a product of leather. The identification and existence of the community hence, is defined by the profession they engage in. 

These mojaris from Jodhpur are produced of pure leather obtained from the carcassess of dead animals including camel, goat, and buffalo sourced from tanneries of Uttar Pradesh. Each leather variant is put into different usage as per its tenacity and outer appearance. Stitched in two parts and indigenously hand embroidered with silver or gold thread procured from Surat, a mojari comes alive through multiple stages. 

With a band of specialized artisans working on a single piece, designs and craftwork is varied for mojaris. The most common motifs are inspired from nature, however, with rampant coupling of cultures, influences of extreme regional arts like Madhubani and Pattachitra are also being found in recent times. As an aesthetic customization of Rajasthanâ€™s utilitarian, but culturally enriched showcase, the artform deserves to be preserved in the competitive global market. The micro-enterprises competing against mainstream product lines demand mobility, and their accessibility to harness technological advancements. While Rajasthan had been a leading producer in leather shoes and articles, urban clusters with factory setting and mass production caused a massive shift of artisans from their traditional labour to wage work.
",Inception of the art,"Woven together as a functional necessity, suitable for long wear, for most pastoral communities in India, mojaris today have become an accessory of luxury and cultural symbolism, usually worn during festive occasions. Mojari artisans in Jodhpur are either self-employed, working for traders or large scale manufacturers. The industry being labour and work intensive, faces a serious threat against the mechanised footwares.",Kashidakaari,"The mojaris of Jodhpur are known for their emauculate designing and workmanship, derived majorly from the hand-done stitching on the upper part of the mojari done by women, skilled in the art. Intricate needle work, all done by hand, lends the method its literal name, kashidakaari. This ancient needle and threadwork technique emerges from the Sindh plateau, now widely practiced by several communities in Kashmir on pashminas and in Rajasthan on mojaris.",Uniqueness,"The mojaris of Jodhpur share a fair amount of similarity with the juttis of Punjab. However they are significantly different in their make. The major difference being, the punjab juttis have a joint in between,while the ones in jodhpur dont have any joints originally. It is also the pointed shape on the toe of the mojari that makes them a signature Rajasthani style exuding the royal lineages.
