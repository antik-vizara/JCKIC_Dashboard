JD-BH,Bone and Horn,7,"There is a rich history of working with bone and horn in India. Bone and horn have been used in India for over 4000 years to make utility items and decorative artefacts. There is archaeological evidence of artefacts made from bone and horn in Indus Valley. So though the bone and horn carving in India though dates back to the pre-historic times, it gained its momentum and wide-scale use post the ban on usage of ivory. Bone and horn craft as seen today in Jodhpur, parts of Uttar Pradesh, Kolkata, and Hyderabad is a remnant of the ancient craft, endangered to say the least. 

The cluster of artisans in Jodhpur is a set of first and second generation of artists, include those that have trained under the ivory master craftsman, wood carvers, inlay workers and metal workers. Different kinds of products ranging from delicately hand carved figures are a reminiscent of ivory craft to inlay work on a wide range of wooden items like jewellery boxes to chairs and tables.

The cluster as a whole produces a multitude of products ranging from jewellery, furniture, home decor items, and uniquely curated animal and natural figurines, influenced from Rajasthani and Mughal miniature art.",Inception of the art,"After the ban on the sale of ivory in 1987, the craftsmen working with ivory moved to the bone and horn material. The craft of bone and horn flourished in Rajasthan and in Jodhpur in particular because of the abundance of artisans and raw material. ",Sustainability,"The bone and horn industry has the potential to meet all three main pillars of sustainable development: Economic growth, Environmental Protection and Social Equity. The raw material is ethically procured from the bodies of dead animals and the cluster contributes to the recycling, reusing, and reducing of waste material.",Bone Inlay Work,"One style that emerges from Jodhpur crafts is the bone inlay style, wherein the shards of bone are extracted from camels, as the horn, ivory and other materials became unethical to use, this one ethical medium continued, with no loss of aesthetic."
JD-LM,Leather Mojari,5,"Craft as a form of socio-cultural expression is best expressed through the making of a leather mojari. A utilitarian product that has gained the currency of a craft item and carries a legacy of a generation of producers and consumers, the Indian mojari stands for the needs and cultural affinity of its wearers. While mojaris are widely produced and worn in Sindh and Punjab in both India and Pakistan, and parts of Gujarat and Rajsthan, they carry a different social significance for each region and community that they are a part of. In Jodhpur, Rajasthan, the Jingar community is involved in the mojari making business. It derives its name from the word jinn that itself means saddle, a product of leather. 

The mojaris from Jodhpur are produced of pure leather obtained from the carcassess of dead animals including camel, goat, and buffalo sourced from tanneries of Uttar Pradesh. Each leather variant is put into different usage as per its tenacity and outer appearance. Stitched in two parts and indigenously hand embroidered with silver or gold thread procured from Surat, a mojari comes alive through multiple stages. 

With a band of specialized artisans working on a single piece, designs and craftwork is varied for mojaris. The most common motifs are inspired from nature, however, with rampant coupling of cultures, influences of extreme regional arts like Madhubani and Pattachitra are also being found in recent times. As an aesthetic customization of Rajasthan’s utilitarian, but culturally enriched showcase, the artform deserves to be preserved in the competitive global market. While Rajasthan had been a leading producer in leather shoes and articles, urban clusters with factory setting and mass production caused a massive shift of artisans from their traditional labour to wage work.
",Inception of the art,"Woven together as a functional necessity, suitable for long wear, for most pastoral communities in India, mojaris today have become an accessory of luxury and cultural symbolism, usually worn during festive occasions. Mojari artisans in Jodhpur are either self-employed, working for traders or large scale manufacturers. ",Kashidakaari,"The mojaris of Jodhpur are known for their emauculate designing and workmanship, derived majorly from the hand-done stitching on the upper part of the mojari done by women, skilled in the art. Intricate needle work, all done by hand, lends the method its literal name, kashidakaari. This ancient needle and threadwork technique emerges from the Sindh plateau, now widely practiced.",Uniqueness,"The mojaris of Jodhpur share a fair amount of similarity with the juttis of Punjab. However the major difference is, the Punjab juttis have a joint in between, while the ones in Jodhpur dont have any joints originally. It is also the pointed shape on the toe of the mojari that makes them a signature Rajasthani style.

JD-TD,Tie and Dye,2,"Dyeing has been the most fundamental skills of adding color and pattern to our textiles.
Tie and Dye, is one such home-grown form of dyeing that has been evolving in the states of Rajasthan and Gujarat. It is believed that origins of this craft are found from the times of the Indus Valley Civilization. Being practised alongside the. The Rangrez and Chippa communities have taken this technique to newer horizons in the state of Rajasthan while combining it with other craft practices like weaving and block printing.

Tie and Dye as the title suggest means a process which involve tying of the fabric using various techniques and followed by a process of dyeing where the fabric is colored by adding it to a dye bath made of different ingredients. Bandhani is one such popular techniques of tie and dye implemented in India.This word is derived from the Sanskrit word ‘bandh’ which means ‘to tie’. Among the many states, tie and dye has flourished slowly and steadily in the state of Rajasthan over the years. Although every artisan develops his/ her uniques style of practising the craft there are 8 major types of Tie and Dye techniques namely: Bandhej/ Bandhani, Tritik, Ikat, Shibori, Mudmee tie-dye, Lahariya, Adire, & Zha Ran. 

The pieces of silk and cotton fabric are pinched, twisted, knotted, and tied into intricate patterns followed by submerging and dipping them in a wide variety of colorful dye bath to create a kaleidoscope of colors and motifs. This technique to create beautiful pattern by keeping certain portions of fabric undyed/uncolored by knotting,pinching,twitsing, tying, clamping, and others is known as resist dyeing. Bandhani is made by pinching, twisting and tying the knots with thread to block white portion of fabric and create patterns. While leheriya involves folding the fabric, twisting and tying of thread to block white portion of fabric and create patterns.After tying these fabrics are dipped or submerged in dyebath to attain the desired color. If the design involves two colors then the fabric is tied again and dipped in the next dye bath, similar process for more than two colors.
",Inception of the art,"Dyeing has been the most primitive way of adding color to the yarns used to make the textiles and hence the fabrics which would be used to drape around or to make clothes. Tie dye is one such surface ornamentation whose depiction is clearly visible even on the clothes depicted in the caves of Ajanta and Elora, proving its existence for many centuries in the processes and skills of Indian textiles.",Leheriya pattern,"Leheriya, derived from the word ‘leher’ which means ‘waves’. Leheriya symbolises hope for the desert people of Rajasthan as they believe that the color and ‘leher’ or wave motif represents the existence of water and associated happiness. Leheriya pagdis (turbans) were worn by almost everyone in this region.",Uniqueness,"Tie and dye is an important craft on its own and also a part of the other time taking craft processes like single and double Ikkat weaving (Patalo weaving a famous craft from Gujarat uses this technique). The details of each and every product is unique and different from each other, no two products have same design. In today’s time of customised products tie and dye craftsmen deliver perfect distinctive products for all."
