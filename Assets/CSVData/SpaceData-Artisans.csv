JD-BH,JD-BH-01,Suresh Chauhan,,Continuing the family legacy,"The importance of family shines through in conversation with the Chauhan Brothers. Even today, Suresh, Lalit Kumar, and Hem Karan Chauhan work together in unison, in an organically mechanised fashion. Each of them has been working in the craft for over 30 years and credits their father, Chunni Lal Ji, a dedicated craftsman for 40+ years, for their skill. They say that following in their father’s footsteps, shifting to other businesses was never given a thought. That being said, the youngest brother, Hem Karan, did try his hand at mojari-making for a while in the '90s alongside his father. But his core passion soon seeped in and he gravitated back towards bone and horn. At one point, each of the brothers tried their hand at the mojari art but found the bone and horn craft more rewarding.",From the 70's to now,"Talking about the timeline of their journey as artisans & businessmen, the brothers took turns to relay the story. In the late 70s, their father, Chunni Lal Ji, first started the business as a bone & horn karigar and around 1989 the three brothers joined him in a professional capacity. Working from home, they started their artistry with products that had floral motif designs carved on Ivory and Sheep Horn. When ivory was banned, they had to change the practice to the new bone raw material. This transition was difficult and labour-intensive as it would take hours to complete a product, unlike ivory bone which was softer and easier to work on. Finally, in 2010, they purchased a factory, which is where they currently work out of. For a couple of years, they had employed a handful of artisans while the demand was good, but COVID hit them hard and now only the three brothers remain in the factory.",Intricacy in Design,"Training for the Chauhan brothers began at a tender age. They would come home from school and sit beside their father, Chunni Lal Ji, and attempt to make the designs he was a master at. They fondly recall getting hurt in the process but returning to perfect the art day after day. The brothers take pride in their creations and praise one another for the aesthetics and intricacy of the designs each of them comes up with. Their signature and most famous design is the Mughal Jaali pattern, a most delicate and meticulous style of carving octagonal and hexagonal patterns into the bone.",Two of their best work,"The Chauhan Brothers speak of 2 products they created that they are proudest of till date. One was a door that was commissioned by a middleman and took the brothers 3 months to make while working simultaneously all day. The door has a royal look as an outcome of the  intricate carving and painting work influenced from the lavish forts of Rajasthan, supplemented with their signature floral motifs and arches. Today, they say, their children have shown them similar doors selling for lacs of rupees in the online marketplace. This knowledge is both a source of pride and sadness for them as they too would like to tap into that market someday. They created another masterpiece during COVID, wherein they were left with more time on their hands due to a decrease in demand – a miniature of the Taj Mahal. A stunning replica that is mounted on a floor made of black & white checks.","Suresh Chauhan, 46, is an Indian artisan working with bone and horn. He is accompanied by his brothers Lalit Chauhan (48) and Hem Karan Chauhan (44) in the same field. Their father, Chunni Lal, was also an artisan of bone and horn and their grandfather was a well-established artisan in the jutti business. All three brothers began their training in the craft during their teenage years under the guidance of their father.
Born and brought up in Jodhpur, these second-generation artisans have seen the shift in the market from ivory to bone and are currently experimenting with mother of pearl and resin work. One of their best-selling patterns, the Mughal Jaali design was extremely popular in the market in the 90s. 
Working in unison, the three brothers eventually bought a factory space in Basani, Jodhpur in 2010, before which they operated entirely from their home.","Suresh Chauhan and his brothers are second-generation artisans from Jodhpur, selling one of the best Mughal Jali design since the 90's."
JD-BH,JD-BH-02,Banwari Lal Dev,,Complexities of the art,"In the summer holidays at the young age of 15, Mr. Banwari Lal worked for no pay under expert craftsmen in a Jodhpur Bone & Horn factory. While his family was involved in farming activities, there was not enough land to cultivate for 5 brothers. Hence, he decided take a different path and learned the art of Bone & Horn. After 12 years of mastering his skill, he decided to start his own venture. Going about both his craft and his business with a calm and composed demeanour, Mr. Lal has only positive things to say about his journey. While narrating the complexities of working with bone pieces for first-timers, he explains that artists have a hard time cutting, smoothening, and shaping the raw material. Any first timer, would get a running nose, burning sensation in his eyes, and a fever at night. The body, he says, takes almost a week to adapt to the pungent smell produced during crafting of the pieces. In fact, one of the major hazards of their work is the chance of injury, which due to the sharp machinery and intricate designs, is a certainty in the beginning. Having laser sharp focus is the baseline requirement for a Bone & Horn karigar.",Adapting to changing markets,"When the need for innovation arises due to fluctuating demand, Mr. Lal has never been one to be rigid. He is constantly innovating and adapting his products as per the changing markets. He also utilised a minimum waste approach with a new line of photo frames. Created from scrapped teak wood left over from other products, these frames were embellished with floral carvings and then finished with different coloured resin poured into the patterns. These frames became best-sellers at several exhibitions and are now a domestic market favourite. Describing the evolution of his work, he explains how, over a decade, the demand for Bone & Horn products shifted entirely from gift items to home furniture. Now, the majority of his business comprises of furniture pieces such as shelves, tables, and drawers. While he still produces home décor items and smaller gifting items, he does so sparingly.",Exhibitions and Delhi Haat,"Mr. Banwari Lal was introduced to exhibitions, and the platform they could give his business, in 2014: when he got a chance to install a shop in an industrial fair and received a positive response from the invited exporters. He also recounts, with much fondness, his visit to the famous Dilli Haat Market of New Delhi. He exhibited there in 2016 through an “artisan card” issued by the Export Promotion Council for Handicrafts (EPCH). With the card, the artisans can set up stalls in exhibitions across the country free of cost. He then exhibited at various places and even got work from 3-4 factories in Jodhpur. The Dilli Haat trip in particular yielded much response in the 15 days he was displaying there. If given an opportunity or if his schedule would allow, he would be more than happy to display at Dilli Haat again. While COVID slowed down physical showcasing, he is optimistic that they will start again.",A collaborative mindset,"According to Mr. Banwari Lal, the survival of the craft is a cumulative of craft knowledge, sustenance of the community, external support, and transfer of knowledge to willing craftspeople. He does not shy away from sharing his knowledge and skill with others, rather encourages it. If anyone were to approach him to learn the art, he says he is always willing to teach them. He explains how he is not hesitant in collaborating with other craftsmen and believes in employing freelance karigars as and when the quantity demands it. His workshop comprises of both seasonal and permanent workers whom he has trained and employed in various capacities. “Agar bada order aata hai toh hum bahar se bhi kara dete hain” [translation: “If a big order comes, we are even okay to give it to an external artisan”]. His abundant positivity towards the community and the craft can be felt by all those around him.","Banwari Lal Dev, 46, is an Indian artisan working with bone and horn. He started learning the craft at the young of 15 when he began working at a factory his one of his elder brothers worked in, during the summer holidays. While his father and family were into farming activities, there was not even land to work on for all 5 brothers. 
After honing his skills for 12 years, Banwari Lal decided to pursue his own independent business and set out to establish his factory. Today, Banwari Lal employs a handful of workers and is majorly involved in the business of furniture products. While 6 workers are permanently employed under him, over the span of the year he engages with upto 20-25 artisans as per the seasonal demand.
His son, Jatin, is currently pursuing his BTech and is pushing his father to explore digital means of marketing.","Banwari Lal Dev has honed the skill of bone and horn since he was 12, now, majorly involved in the business of furniture products."
JD-BH,JD-BH-03,Jakir Hussain,,The Artist,"Jakir Hussain’s pride is deeply tied to his art. His high level of mastery and skill in the bone and horn art form cannot be easily replicated in an assembly line. Honing his skill from a very young age, he was merely 10 years old when he began working as a polisher in an aluminium factory. Being a first-generation artisan, he learnt the skill by making his way up in the aluminium factory from polishing to grinding and eventually working on bone and horn materials. His family has always been his anchor and his mother even supported him financially when he first got started. Now, both his sons are actively involved in the trade and helping their father wherever possible. His work has been exhibited widely around the world, including in Italy, Iraq, Iran, and Dubai. His life and work are a testimony to how indomitable Indian artisans are; he has demonstrated this by finding solutions in the face of many obstacles ranging from social, economic, and material.",A craft community,"The craft community associated with Mr. Hussain is diverse and holistic. While currently there are only two workers with whom he is closely connected and who work under him, he shares many instances and stories where a multitude of workers from different communities had worked under him. The bond he shared with them was one of mutual respect and admiration. He enjoys imparting knowledge of the craft to others and his passion shines through his words. He fondly recalls training many NIFT, NID, and FDDI students who stayed in touch with him long after their engagement ended. He treats them and speaks of them like his extended family. Urging more and more people to spread knowledge on the craft, he is hellbent on preserving the legacy of the bone and horn industry.",Products of passion,"A craft is best engrained at a younger age, according to Ustad Hussain. He believes that crafting is a cognitive skill, and an adult would be a slower learner than a child. He himself began practising handiwork at the age of 10 and attributes this to his mastery of the art form. Although there are governmental restrictions on the involvement of children in the industry, Mr. Hussain encourages anyone willing to learn the art form, to lay their hands on it at a younger age. A style that he prides himself on is working on products made from pure bone, which is a skill that is much tougher to become proficient at. For Mr. Hussain his passion lies in the art and his designs rather than building a business, and his products showcase his expertise thoroughly. He has created multiple stand-out pieces such as a statement Table with multiple games that took him 2 years to complete, a Taj Mahal replica that took around 2-3 years to make, a Chess Set that he prides himself on, and a 10-foot Train that won him the National Award in 2011. These are but some pieces that are close to his heart and will never be sold.",National Award in 2011,"Mr. Hussain was awarded the highest civilan honour in India for his craft when he was given the National Award in 2011. The award was given to him for his artistry on a 10-foot train that took him between 2007 – 2011 to make. He recalls that he was sceptical and uncertain when he received a phone call saying that he will be given the National Award that year. It wasn’t until the letter arrived from the Ministry of Textiles, Govt. of India stating the date and event of his award that he was certain of the same. Describing the intricacy of the design, he explains how he painstakingly modelled the train to be as close to the real Darshan trains as possible. The model has wheels that are fully functional and actually move on the railways track that he built under it. The engine of the model is an exact replica of the actual engine that is used, and he has carved more than 100 miniature statues of passengers that are placed inside the showpiece, including the driver. He explains why he didn’t leave the model in its natural state of white, which is his signature, as it would eventually start to look old over the years and so to preserve and enhance its beauty he got miniature paintings done all around the train.","Jakir Hussain, 56, is an Indian artisan working with bone and horn. His craftwork has earned him accolades from the state, central, and international art critics & governments alike. He has been acknowledged with the Rashtrapati [National] award in 2011 for his exemplary work in crafting a 10-foot model of a train.
Born & brought up in Jodhpur, Jakir is a first-generation craftsman. His father, Sattar Hussain was a building contractor and his mother a teacher. 
Jakir left school in class 7 to support his family and started working in a metal sculpture factory where he learnt the art of polishing aluminium artefacts. Later he transferred these skills to the craft of Ivory carving and eventually to bone and horn.
His style and the products he makes are unique and difficult to replicate as the skill required is very high.","Jakir Hussain, a National Award winner has a unique style and the products he makes are unique and difficult to replicate as the skill required is very high."
JD-BH,JD-BH-04,Kamal Kishor Soni,,Duplication in Art,"Mr. Soni has been practicing the craft of Bone and horn for more than 40 years. He comes from a lineage of craftsmen and had the full support of his family while entering the industry. He distinguishes between an artist and a businessman while talking about how secrecy in earlier times was helpful in retaining the integrity of the craft. Art is personal, for it’s an artist’s expression of himself and is one of his most prized possessions. Recounting his initial days, Mr. Soni narrates how artisans didn’t allow anyone to enter their workshop spaces, to protect their designs. However, today, he says, any sample that enters the market is easily copied. But he has a positive spin on the trend – he says, in a light-hearted manner that he feels proud if someone copies his work as imitation is a form of flattery. He is confident puts out that he is not afraid of competition, as he prefers to focus on his work rather than trouble himself with what others are doing. He favours individuality and innovation, and strives to better his art with each product.",A glimpse into his mind,"Talking about his journey and the industry, Mr. Soni recalls when he got started he worked alone and used to visit multiple factories to ask for work. Slowly, over the years as his production increased he hired more labour. While he feels that the importance and respect given to an artisan were higher in the years he started, he has noticed an upward trend occurring across the nation today. People are becoming more sensitive and appreciative of the intricacies of handicrafts, he believes. His most successful products have been smaller gifting items such as paintings and carved products, as well as his recent innovation of studded bangles. He is always open to trying new things, and once incorporated feedback from some businessmen to introduce more products with a wooden base. Doing so, impacted him positively as the response for the newer range received was good. One platform he stays away from, however, are exhibitions. Narrating an experience from around 1997, he says he went for an exhibition through ‘Vastra Mantralaya’ [Ministry of Textiles] to Kolkata. Additional stock had to be created prior to the event, and the exhibition ended up not being profitable as he did not sell most of his products. Since then, he’s never thought to put up a stall in any other such fair.",Sources of inspiration,"While the miniatures painted and embossed on the bone and horn artifacts derive their inspiration from Rajasthani and Mughal style of miniature paintings, Mr. Soni views young talent as a reservoir of design ingenuity. Designer students from institutions like NID and NIFT often come to him for training and they bring with them their vivid worldview and creative minds. Mr. Soni says that as soon as their zeal to learn and theoretical know-how is put to practical use, the results are very rewarding. The designs are unique and fresh; giving him exposure to newer designs as an artist. He does not levy any economic charges from these training sessions, rather, for him, it is a healthy exchange of ideas, a platform for reflection, and a communicative process between artisans of similar fields. This exchange of abilities reflects in the products that Mr. Soni brings to the market.",Workers like family,"Mr. Soni believes in maintaining long-term relationships with his workers and treats them as his own family. He acknowledges the hard work that each worker puts in for they work a daily of 8-10 hours in the factory. He wishes them success and does not come in the way of their learning or growth. If a worker wishes to pursue an individual path, he isn’t hesitant to let the worker go. To create any piece, collaboration with other skilled workers is necessary and thus contractual labourers are often part of the process: the end products demand woodcraft, metal work, and hand-painting mastery. This makes inter-communal knowledge exchange a common occurrence in the bone and horn industry. Mr. Soni explains that his workers come from diverse backgrounds, which facilitates cultural intermingling whilst stimulating a sense of belongingness and allegiance towards the craft.","Kamal Kishor Soni, 60, is an Indian artisan working with bone and horn. He comes from a rich lineage of craftsmen. His father, Late Meghraj Soni, was an artisan of bone and horn and his grandfather was an experienced goldsmith. He began learning the craft at the age of 12, alongside his father at a factory. 
In 1987-88, he set up his own factory with one singular machine that he bought from his savings. From then to now, he has slowly grown his business and expanded operations to employ several workers. 
He is satisfied with the local market demand and has innovated along the way to keep up with changing market trends. He attributes small gifting items and jewellery to be his most successful product lines. In his workspace, also his home, you would see a large variety of products from home décor pieces and jewellery to window frames and small furniture.","Kamal K. Soni, set up his own factory with one singular machine that he bought from his savings, now employing several workers. "
JD-BH,JD-BH-06,Rahmat Ali & Mhd. Faruk,,Access to market,"Ali owes a lot of his market expansion to his collaboration and guidance under the Export Promotion Council for Handicrafts. The multiple exhibitions in Delhi organized by EPCH opened up windows for exporter collaborations and even training sessions. They have, needless to say, served as a large market for most of the bone and horn artisans. Recalling his experience, Ali cites spaces like the Hunar Art in Pragati Maidan, and ExpoMart in Noida, from his initial exhibit days. A regular clientele also came from the Chatta Chowk, Red Fort, and Sundernagar in New Delhi, both of which have initiated the production of a new product line like the bone embossed canes. Other small gifting items that find their place in the local market have been continuously produced ever since Ali started contributing to the business. Hoteliers, affluent classes and interior decorators constitute a large chunk of the local customer base. Except for a lull in the time frame of 2007-2008, Ali has been fairly satisfied with the economic growth and revenue generation means. According to him, the market has served him well, even during the pandemic.",People's perception towards the craft,"Through the years of his father and his time, Ali has observed a significant increase in the demand of the craft. He proudly recalls an expansion in the number of workers and space, which are significant markers of a blooming market which has led to product diversification. In most cases like the introduction of furniture in the industry has been an after-effect of branching customer demands. For consumers overseas, the craft is more alluring. However, in local markets, the demand may be lower, but craft understanding is much higher owing to relatability and cultural resemblance.",Alternative raw materials,"The creative industry thrives on alternative raw materials and mass produced manufactures that act are cheaper and less laborious. Such materials garner the attraction of new consumer bases, owing to their affordability. One such material that Ali often substitutes with bone is plastic sheet. He narrates how the demand for such substitutes also arises from the demand of the buyers, who demand similar textures and designs at lower costs. Ali doesn’t shy away from admitting that he does engage in the production of such items, but also realises that the demand for duplicate materials like plastic is selective. The life, strength and creativity of bone artefacts continues to stay favourable than its cheaper alternatives.",Mutual Trust building,"According to Ali, an artist’s true character is defined by the quality of their art produced. It is also what enables the artist to build contacts, garner recognition and create their own identity. The creative abilities of an artist help in spreading good word about them, which further lends credibility to the business the artist develops. Ali is affirmative about an artisan’s ability to build a business purely on the basis of their hard-work and creative abilities. And hence, he also believes in the an equivalent growth in the consumer base.","Rahmat Ali, 38 and his brother Mohammad Faruk, are Indian artisans working with bone and horn. They are second-generation craftsmans, following the footsteps of their father. In 1998, at the age of 14, when Rahmat Ali travelled to Jodhpur to receive his higher education, his father, Zamaludin Ji was keen for him to start practising the craft. And so, he began his training the same year. 
The father-son duo worked together in both the crafting process and in building the business. In 2000, they decided to take a step to expand their business and bought a new place in Shilpgram, Jodhpur which was an area dedicated to artisans and they received support in the form of subsidiaries. In 2006, Rahmat Ali took over the business and started expanding his network outside of the local market. 
Finally, in 2012 he took an executive decision to stop the production of small gifting items and focus solely on furniture products. A decision that has serves him well till date.","Rahmat Ali, an artisan since he was 14 specializes in bone furniture that he produces in Shilpgram, Jodhpur."
JD-BH,JD-BH-07,Haji Ibrahim Ali,,Growth in export business,"Ever since Ibrahim sahab started in the 80’s the market has been largely domestic, with a handful of exporters. Although exporting was not new, given the ivory industry had flourished with exports of jewelery, home decor items, and ivory inlaid artefacts, it was scarcely essential. With the domestic markets in Delhi, Jaipur and Bombay booming, the prerogative of the exporters was needless at the least. However, the face of the market changed in the 90’s and post that. As the demand grew and competition increased, costs fell severely. Showroom sales, and local markets were not enough to compensate for the artistry. Soon enough, Ibrahim and his cohorts resorted to exporter sales that converged their markets and opened an arena undiscovered. As for Ibrahim sahab, the export business has been serving well for the last 29 years. And, surprisingly, his collaboration tends to only one exporter for the last 3 decades. A relationship catered with trust, intra-communal respect and mutual economic benefit, Ibrahim sahab has enabled a business that ensures an annual turnover of a whooping 2 crores.",Coping with the ivory ban,"As a young artisan, Ali worked under the tutelage of the 5-6 big names of the industry of that time in Raikabagh. In his initial days, when ivory was available in the market, he tried his hand at inlay and finishing work. However, post the ban on ivory, the raw material was restricted to licensed traders, there were only a handful of them though. Traders from Sambal, Moradabad took it upon themselves to provide the artisans in Jodhpur with an alternative raw material. Ali fondly recalls Chotu Khan from Sambal, who brought with him both bone and shells with him. While shells proved to be a health hazard for many, bone was fairly adept. Ali narrates how Khan enabled him to switch from ivory to bone smoothly. The same technical knowledge, machinery used and creative avenues, for most artisans remained the same during this switch.",Segue into the craft,"Ibrahim Ali has been working in the bone and horn industry for almost 34 years now. His creative intellect and agility has been strong held throughout these years. However, the choice to join the industry wasn’t free will for Ali. Ali , recalls his childhood as one where education was prioritized. His forefathers from Sindh has been pastoralists since ages, but his father particularly wanted his children to practice a less laborious task, that would not require any physical strains. For most of Ali’s childhood, he aimed to join the government services. But as recession hit, due to lack of job opportunities, the family began to encourage their children to train in an artform. It was his father’s farsightedness that made Ali venture into alternate career options, finally landing in the bone and horn industry.",Future of the craft,"According to Ibrahim Ali, the future of bone and horn is booming. He is positive about the demand of bone and horn artefacts to increase in the coming years, in both the domestic and international market. Ali attributes this growth to the globally expanding economy and the recognition of handcrafted products worldwide. Ali recalls that he has been advised to change his profession several times in the last 30 years, owing to the fear of decreasing demand of handmade items. But his personal opinion differs. For him, the world is his market, and till the time humanity lives, the demand for his craft stays alive.","Haji Ibrahim Khan, 59, is an Indian artisan working with bone and horn. He has been practising the art craft for more than 40 years. In 1978, he moved to Jodhpur and became a first-generation bone and horn craftsman, where he learnt the craft from the Manyara community. While his father and grandfather were farmers, his brother are closely associated with him since 1982. 

His initial practice began with the repair work of ivory items, but with an increase in the market demand for bone and horn and the ban on ivory, Mr. Khan switched the raw materials. Ever since he took up the craft, his focus has been on the export market, which has rendered its profitability over the years. In his view, the craft and its value have evolved substantially, while the market for the craft has seen a remarkable difference. 
Today, his firm manufactures a wide range of furniture products along with gift and home decor items.","Haji Ibrahim Khan, an experience artisan manufgactures a range of products including gifts and home decor, mostly for export."
JD-BH,JD-BH-08,Imamuddin,,Secrecy in artworks,"Imammudin sahab, unlike many artisans, does not advocate discreteness. He rather gives in to the inevitability of it, and utilizes the open market to his own profitability. His process, mechanics and art is open to viewers and learners. Sahab’s trust on his creativity and credibility is long drawn for him to be confident. Imammudin sahab recalling his experience with market fluidity and product copies says that there seems to be no predictability to such issues. It is an irreversible effect, for which neither the artist or the art itself is responsible, he very earnestly gives in to the destiny of an artist. Rather, suggests for all artists to take it up as an opportunity to rejuvenate themselves. While showrooms carry a sense of suspense for the buyer, public displays like exhibitions hardly create any confidentiality. With ample chances of duplication, the products of an artist are open to rip offs at such spaces. On the contrary, private sellers were more wary of duping, often for their own benefit, and went to an extent of no photography policy. However, as of today, quantity has preceded over quality, and it is rare to find singular unique pieces.",Changes in customer base,"The customer base for born and horn artefacts has been ever changing and transforming. In the 46 years of his professional journey, Imammudin Sahab has seen a range of consumer exposure. Recounting his experience, he narrates how international markets have always been more favourable than the domestic ones. The demand of decorative handmade items has been inflowing from the southern states of India, rather than the northern regions. The unfavourable market conditions may have emerged due to the taboos associated to the material of bone in several Indian cultures. In a series of product diversification, the artisans of the industry have hence identified these variations and created a target audience that remains loyal to them.",A community's craft,"For the art of bone and horn to flourish, there are several communities who potluck their skills and crafts. Each of this community has a different trajectory of growth and measure of involvement. Hwoever, one commonality between all, remains their communal identification through the generations. Imammuddin sahab recalls how the Sutars (wood workers) and bone and horn artisans share an intimate relation to produce bone artefacts. Communities, both local and migrated from the regions of Sindh and Pakistan, have been key members of the bone and horn craft community. Predefined professional identities (jati) have been instrumental in the creation and facilitation of these communities, especially in the Marwar region. Imammudin attributes these distinctions as favourable conditions for the creative industry flourishing in the state.",Design innovations through the years,"Designs and their experimentation on bone and horn artefacts remains limited in terms of actual implementation, given the quality of the raw material. According to Imammudin sahab, the innovation in patterns used and inlay techniques has not changed much over the years. Most bone and horn artisans use three types of wood, mango, sheesham and babool for carvings. The technique of inlay remains the same for all three. As a craft of Rajasthan, the artefacts do become symbols of Rajasthan’s cultural diversity. Motifs inspired from artwork of different regions of Barmer, Jaipur, Jodhpur and Udaipur become prominent design features for handicrafts. More than often, it is Imamuddin’s and his co-worker’s own imagination and the demand of the consumer that gives shape to design innovations.","Imammuddin, 57, is an Indian artisan working with bone and horn. A first-generation bone and horn artist, his father and forefathers were farmers in Pipar city. He migrated to Jodhpur in 1979, and with the help of his brother Haji Ibrahim Khan, he began practicing the craft. His initial training was gained as a factory worker under the Manyara community, where he produced small gift items and home decor products in ivory. 

As his brother’s associate, Imamuddin gave up his job at the factory, and together they up their own factory in 1987. Later on, however, he separated from his brother and set up his own firm in 1989. 
At the beginning of his career, small gift items were heavily in demand. However, in the 1990’s the demand for furniture saw an exceptional increase in the international market, which Imamuddin caters to date.","Imammuddin, a first-generation artist, worked as a factory worker, before joining his brother, to produce large scale small gifting items. "
JD-LM,JD-LM-01,Mohan Lal Gujar,,Socio-cutural manifestations in footwear,"The mojaris of Rajasthan have been an imminent Feature for the Representation and the manifestation of the cultural and social identities of the communities  residing in the state. Mohan Lal Gujjar Ji,  recalls mojari as a tool of communal distinctions, based on their make, pattern and usage. The famous pointed mojari,  usually in black leather,  also known as the bichchu mojari,  was typically worn by the agriculturists  of the arid region to scare away insects found in the desert.  
This variety of mojari is utilitarian and its minimalistic design was favourable for long distance walking and rough and tough use. While on the contrary the Bindoli mojari,  worn by the groom during wedding functions was a bright coloured mojari,  that was used to display the extravagance of the wedding as a marker of socio cultural affluence.
",Skill development trainings,"Mohan Lal ji and his family have been pioneers in spreading their craft knowledge to the immediate family members, and also the community members who were previously distant from the craft. This dissemination and transfer of knowledge has been conducted in the Jodhpur and outside region, under the guidance of apex organizations like the Export Promotion Council of Handicraft, with who Mohan Lal Ji has been collaborating since his initial days. The EPCH has been equally responsible for several soft skill workshops conducted by Mohan Lal Ji, on mojari making. 
Skill development training workshops in remote locations and among underprivileged communities has been a catalyst for socio-economic growth of the communities being trained and provides an equal opportunity to the artist to rejuvenate their craft. Such workshops undertaken with designers and students of the field have been a platform for craft innovation and product diversification, says Mohan Lal ji. The workshops an training sessions are conducted by him and his wife equally, who specilizes in embroidery of the mojari, and is an active member of the women societies that fall under her jurisdiction.
",Royal patronages and recognitions,"Mohan Lal ji is a well recognized and respected player in the leather mojari industry of Jodhpur, and even outside. ‘Kabhi kabhi toh itni bheed ho jaati hai yahan ki police pareshaan hai’ (Translation: Sometimes it gets so crowded here that the police gets fed-up) while talking about how his home is constantly flooded with VIP guests, and the narrow lanes leading upto his home face regular traffic congestions. A regular supplier of the royal family, not just in Jodhpur, but a lot of other royal families in rajasthan, including the royal family of United Kingdom. 
Mohan Lal Ji takes pride in customizing mojaris for Maharaja Gaj Singh, the current king of Jodhpur and his family. His collection for the royal family stands out in its uniqueness and craftsmanship. While narrating the anecdote of meeting Prince Charles at the Mehrangarh fort, Jodhpur, Mohan Lal Ji blissfully reminisces the glory of presenting India, his craft and community on a global platform. 
",Market and customer expansion,"According to Mohan lal ji, the expansion of the customer base and markets for mojaris can be attributed to the fashion industry and its broadening horizons. Mojaris were initially a utilitarian product for most of rural India, however, now the simple piece of footwear has become a style statement. The fashion industry has lent its impetus to the mojari as a product of trend. The craze for mojaris in urban areas is beneficial for most fo the artisans and favourable for their creative journeys. 
Each of these factors owes its evolution to popular culture contributing towards the popularization of the product along with its mainstream representation in the fashion industry. The ability of the mojari to sell itself as a symbol of Indian handicrafts and workmanship has enabled it to become a regular feature in the Indian weddings, initiating a regular and high demand across diasporas.

JD-LM,JD-LM-02,Mahesh Kumar Chauhan,,Unfaced legacies,"Mahesh Kumar Chauhan’s family has traditionally comprised of craftspeople. However, it has not been a smooth transition over the years. While his grandfather was a mojari maker who specialized in traditional forms and designs of mojari, his father, hesitantly chose a more ‘stable’ government job. The craft was however, never lost in the family. The women of the family, including Chauhan’s mother who were skilled embrioders, continued to strengthen the ties of the family with the art that has sustained them for years. After venturing into tailoring and other occupations, Chauhan returned to mojari making in 2018. His endevours were however slightly different from his predecessors. Having worked as a service provider previously, he understood the demands of the changing market, and hence preferred to experiment and produce cost efficient vegan mojaris, that have now become his signature style.",Shifts in marketing mechanisms,"Chauhan began his mojari business a little before the pandemic hit in. But he has been resilient through it all, in his ways of navigating and adjusting to the means of marketing. Chauhan’s son Kapil has been particularly instrumental in pacing his father’s business according to the needs of the current market. With the involvement of Kapil, who reached out to several exhibitions, the father-son duo was able to steerhead their business even while a lull time. 
Marketing initiatives have been the prerogative of Chauhan’s son Kapil, who with his new generation knowledge and reach has initiated social media and investments in branding that his father had remained aloof of. With his initiatives, he aims to make his family brand a household name in the mojari industry. 
",Innovations to expand customer base,"Mahesh Chauhan and his son Kapil, who currently run the business together also are incharge of innovating and maintaining a steady value chain. They take pride in have created a market for themselves, within the mojari industry. While a lot of their competitors focus on reviving the traditional mechanisms of mojari making, including indigenous designs and methodologies of the artwork, Kapil is proud to have shifted from the traditional mojaris, that are a once in a while use footwear, according to him. He claims that his rubber PV sole mojaris are a perfect blend of tradition and innovation that aim at longevity and can be put to daily use. Their products are comfortable for those who are not used to wearing moajris, but want to experience it. The use of velvet and block printing cloth, is what lends their mojaris its USP. 
His market presence may have been short compared to others, but his knowledge about the craft and technical experience is authentic and long-lived, claims Chauhan. And it is this indepth know-how that lends him the ability to innovate with agility.
","A community's labour then, and now","The Jingar community in the medieval times engaged in producing sword covers in leather, post which they learnt and started making leather mojaris that were more widely demanded. Till date, the community holds its prominence in the leather mojari industry and dominates it. However, it has never been a single community’s labor. The whole process engages and takes leverage of the communal identities that were divided on the basis of professions. In the case of the leather mojari, Kapil Chauhan narrates that the hefty task was possible because of the contributions of three different communities: the Meghwals, the Regars and the Jingars. While the Regars primarily prepared the leather, the Meghwals did further preparation and finishing, and the Jingars bought the prepared leather from the Regars and Meghwals and prepared the Mojaris. The symbiotic relationship between these communities ensured the successful production of the beautiful mojaris that we finally see. 
As of today, all the three classes are involved in the craft, but rarely can an outsider differentiate. The economic lives of these communities are interdependent and function in cohesion, which is sacred to the members of these communities alone. 
","Mahesh Kumar Chauhan, 48, is a leather mojari artisan from Jodhpur. A third generation mojari maker, Chauhan learnt the craft of tailoring and embroidery from a young age. However, his entry into the mojari industry has been as late as in 2018. And even though the craft prexisted in his family, he learnt it from his maternal cousin in Haryana. Owing to his learning being from outside the realms of his community in Jodhpur, Chauhan’s craft has several traces of innovation. 
Unlike traditional mojaris, he uses block printed fabric as design elements. His primary aim has been to reduce the production costs and upscaling production through a variety of cost reduction exercises, glueing rather than stitching being one such.  His venture of producing vegan mojaris has been highly successful in the new market, and proportionately increased his customer base. 
Although Mahesh Kumar entered the market of leather mojari much later than his competitors, and lacks training and recognitions, he has efficiently managed to create a niche for himself and his products in the market.

JD-LM,JD-LM-03,Kailash Panwar,,Transitions and transmissions,"According to Kailash ji, not much has changed over the years in the leather mojari industry. The communities that procure and trade in the raw materials, the Regars and Meghwals, continue their ancestral means of employment. The methods and mechanisms for the production of the mojari too haven’t undergone any significant shifts, baring the minute design influences and technological interventions, that have managed to seamlessly incorporate in the industry by the efforts and willingness of the artisans. Most of the machinery is utilised for adding the decorative elements like piping and finishing the final product. For most artisans, the handwork involved in the making of a mojari is sacred and is a display of their functional skills. But several of these artisans, including Kailash ji don’t visualise a future for the industry, due to which they are hesitant to encourage their children to take up the craft and continue it.",Intra-community labour division,"Mojari making is a collective craft. The Pawar family migrated from their ancestral village to Jodhpur looking for better job opportunities. They treasured their craft and initiated to expand on the same, in urban areas as well. Regardless of their spatial location, the family has been working together, earlier as agriculturalists and now as artisans. Although the production of mojaris was limited, and leather was put into multiple uses, most of the family today is engaged in the mojari business.
Kailash Pawar and his extended family often come together to pitch in their skills and complete larger orders that come in. Each of the family members hone a different skill set that contributes to the uniqueness of the overall product that the family produces. While women master in embroidery, especially of the upper sole, men are more adept with dealing with the raw material and finishing. 
",Spreading wings in the creative industry,"Kailash Pawar ji started learning and practicing the craft at a tender age, owing to which he had to leave his education mid-way post 8th standard. However, he values education as a strong pillar of growth and encourages his four children to educate themselves. He, simultaneously wishes to develop a creative intellect among them. When asked about his children’s involvement in mojari making, he denies it. Rather his daughters show a keen expression of interest in painting and henna designing. According to him, their personal pursuits value greater than the familial professions. Pawar ji isn’t hesitant of taking external suggestions in matters like these, rather, he appreciated when one of his clients suggested him to teach his daughters painting, which he gladly then accepted and pursued.",Selective intervention,"Kailash Pawar acknowledges the fact that there are new means of putting your product out to the market, and most of his external connections these days are established through GoogleAds and the attention that his artwork garners through it. Given that, there have not been drastic transitions in the way raw material is procured or labor is outsourced. It is still a word of mouth relation that is build on trust among known members and work relatives. Hence, the interventions that these traditional artisans allow are also restrictive in nature. Similarly, mechanisation in the industry is also partial, and has able to intervene in the process that were labor intensive. Other than that, the indigenous means of production and trade retain their centrality in majority of the craft.","Kailash Panwar, 37, is a leather mojari artisan from Jodhpur. Having learnt the craft at a very young age, Kailash was only 18 when he took over the family business. His training for the industry occurred under the tutelage of Balla Ram Ji, a thriving businessman. The 2 year apprenticeship honed Kailash Ji the skills to start his independent practice in 2005. He has also undertaken training from the Central leather Research Institute, an institution that along with providing Pawar the skill set, also gave him a sewing machine, a valuable investment for his business. As of today, he is supported by his wife, Rameshwari Ji, who has an expertise in embroidery on the mojari uppers. Over the years, Kailash ji has adapted to new shapes and embroidery designs and allowed a few technological interventions.","Kailash Panwar, began his independent practice in 2005, supported by his wife Rameshwari Ji, specializing in traditionally embroidered footwear. "
JD-LM,JD-LM-04,Sagar Gujjar,,Craft transcending boundaries,"Sagar Gujjar’s father Nandumal Gujjar migrated from Pakistan’s Hyderabad to Jodhpur, India about 35 years ago in search of better job opportunities. His grandfather though had been a part fo the footwear industry in Pakistan, he practiced the technique of pasting uppers and soles to make slippers. Carrying the knowledge and legacy of his father, Nandumal ji crossed borders with his family and adopted the craft of mojari making. His training in the field of mojaris was acquired by the local artisans of Jodhpur, including Bansi Lal ji and Kanti Lal ji who provided him with guidance and moral support through the journey of their professional switch. When in 1987, Nandumal Ji changed his nationality, he also brought about a change in the designs and techniques in the market. Contrary to Pakiza and Sapat, the only two styles of mojari existing at the time, he brought about technical changes that brought new sizes and shapes in mojaris. ",Collaborative workforce in the craft,"Nandumal Ji and his sons developed a new variant of mojaris in Jodhpur, with the technical know-how of their prior journey. While Nandumal ji’s initial strategy of labor was singular workforce, he soon realised that his business will not be able to grow that way. He brought about changes in workforce and labor by outsourcing, and making use of the unemployed but skilled craftsmen across the city. Leveraging the inidviual strengths of the craftsmen, he enabled employment for a minimum of 5 people in the making of one moajri, in his words. As products diversified and quantities increased, this method of employment helped a lot more artisans than what was possible before. Alongwith a collaborative effort among artisans who migrated from the lands across the borders and existing practitioners in Jodhpur, Nandumal Ji mitigated his own professional growth.",Women employement and outsourcing,"Most of the Gujjar’s workforce is outsourced, majority of them being women. Nandumal Ji has employed more than 30 women in their locality in Jodhpur. These women who work in the comfort of their own homes as daily wage artisans are skilled in embroidery work. For each piece that they embroider, a fixed price is given to them. While the raw material and post embroidery maufacturing labor is provided by Nandumal ji and his sons, the intervention of these women is integral to the mojari making process as their skill is unique to them. Now remaining a handful, women who have the know-how of kashidakaari, the inidgenous embroidery and its patterns are declining in numbers. Reliance on mechanised means and geometric patterns has multiplied the value of these small scale women workers and their skill-set. ",New design inspirations,"Nandumal ji’s sons Dinesh and Sagar Gujjar took over the family business post their father suffered a heart condition and became unfit for rigorous labor work. With a background in commerce, the brothers brought in an added knowledge of new age technological and marketing skills along with ideas for business expansion. The brothers have also been instrumental in enabling new design features in the existing methods of mojari manufacturing. Design inspirations, they say, come from constant experimentation and innovationm through the years. The internet has become a space for the same. They have been on a journey to reinvent some of their ancestral designs by making minor changes in them. An ongoing effort for the brothers is to bring in means of mechanisation in the field, owing to the gradual decrease in the number of mojari artisans and also to increase cost efficiency.","Sagar Gujjar, 26, is a leather mojari artisan from Jodhpur. Sagar and his brother Dinesh, following their father’s footsteps have more recently taken over the family business of mojari making. Their father, Nandumal ji, migrated form Pakistan to India in search of better employement opportunities and with that he brought several improvements to the process, sizing of mojaris and new variants of raw materials, being some of them. Post the takeover, the brothers have been particularly interested in bringing their education of marketing and technological know-how into practice and expanding the business.  
Sagar’s new ventures including skill development among household women, new designs and makes of mojaris, inclusion of brand marketing and social media accession have opened avenues for collaborations and new-age business. Their prospective future plans are to incorporate machinery to make the process cost effective and learn the craft of footwear designing to keep up with the latest trends in shoes.

JD-LM,JD-LM-05,Mahendra Songara,,External support and collaborations,"Mahendra Songara and his father Mancharam ji have been renowned players in the mojari industry for decades now. During the time of his father, the family run business was self sufficient and had a wide domestic market. Their daily sales in Jodhpur only were exceedingly well, due to which they never had to engage in any collaborations or seek any government support. Mahendra ji recalls craft associations and other institutional offers that came along his way years ago. However, they demanded a significant number of products at one time and were insufficient in profit yielding. Unable to produce beyond their capacity and inconsistency in trade were the major reasons for the initiation of any collaboration between the family and external organizations.",Creating a niche in the market,"Mahendra Songara’s designs are unique and contrary to what his contemporaries produce, have a much modern look and usability, he claims. Most of the designs are shoe shaped that have gained their inspiration and impetus from the market demand caused during the wedding season. The Songara’s recall manufacturing a customized mojari for a groom in the mid 2000’s, post which loafer style mojaris became a customer favorite and the most produced variety for their brand. Their current product range experiments with loafers in different designs and using materials like velvet, catering to the daily-use and festive needs of the consumers. They have been able to create a niche for themselves in the market through the production of similar products that appeal to the younger generation owing to their comfor, design and feasible usage. Most of their products gained visibility in the mojari market through word of mouth and the customization feature that they provided.",Non-feasibility of e-commerce,"While Mahendra Songara has been a proponent of technological interventions in the field to make the process of mojari making cost effective and faster, he is not a big fan of showcasing his products on e-commerce platforms. Recalling the high return rates for the online sold products, Mahendra ji calls it a non-viable platform. He attributes the reason for these high returns as a malpractice by the customer, who he assumes wears the mojari and returns it within the days of allowance. He is also vary of the selling prices quoted by most websites, that include a commission cut for the portal itself, making the portal economically non-beneficial. In case of returns, the added costs of shipping cause an added brunt on the wholesaler. In totality, hence, the most suitable medium of sale is through direct sales to showrooms.",Road to brand building,"Mahendra Songara and his sons have been working relentlessly towards building their own brand and identity in the mojari market. Their designs, business plans and means of upscaling the process of mojari making, is aimed towards making MR Jodhpur, a household brand. They refrain from collaborations intentionally so as to avoid competition. A brand that is anmed after his later father and expands the craft set up by him, Mahendra Songara is working towards building an empire that caters to all ages and needs in the footwear industry. For the sake of optimizing resources and maximising profits, he has adapted cost-efficient means by incorporating machinery and outsourcing labor. On the way to building a sustainable brand with longevity in the market, it is Songara’s dream to take his father’s name to higher skies.","Mahendra Songara, 52, is a leather mojari artisan from Jodhpur. His family being a native to the city, has been practicing the craft since his grandfather’s time. Mahendra Ji himself joined the family business post completing his matriculation at the tender age of 14 years. His individual business has been thriving since the last 20 years, where he aims to continue his father’s legacy and name. His brand MR Jodhpur is also a symbolic tribute to his father. 
His products have a unique make that resemble a lot to the mass produced shoes, with a wide range of men’s collection, contrary to his competitors. He and his son have initiated a few machine interventions to reduced human labour and make the process a little faster. Their best selling product, the Rajasthani juti is also one of his personal favourites.

JD-SD,JD-SD-01,Jamaluddin Khan,,Employement diversification,"Jamaludin Khan’s ancestors from Sindh practiced the craft of block printing, but faced the constant fear of water scarcity. To keep their employment opportunities open and running, enough to sustain the needs of the family, they optimized their available resources, including the 40 bigha fertile land they owned. Now, Khan and his son have also resorted to a similar practice. Though the craft they practice has changed to durry weaving, for the months when the market is down and ample water is available, farming is a viable option. It not just adds up to some extra income during the financially dry days, but also keeps their legacy of farming, running. Like most of their peers in durry weaving, the Khan family too has kept their sources of income diverse, owing to the instability in the weaving industry. Farming, however, is completely rain fed and weaving, a comercial practice market dependent.
",Family legacy,"Khan’s family migrated to Pali in Marwar from Nagar Thatha in Sindh, Pakistan.Initially there was a need for printers and so they became Chippa’s and over 300 years they moved to weaving dhurries as there was a bigger market for durries.  Legend says that Jamaluddin’s family and his ancestors used to weave for the royal king Sumro of Jodhpur, about 800 years ago. Jamaluddin recollects that his family were also engaged in weaving beds or Khats with Niwar. They believe that they are descendents of the Khatri community and had the knowledge of all processes related to fabrics. His grandfather and ancestors were employed by the ruling families and made durries only for them. In fact, Jamaluddin remembers that the entire family was supported by the ruling classes, paying for weddings and funerals. As of today, there are about 50 chippa families in the Guda village, out of whom Jamaluddin and his son are the only remaining practioners of the craft.
",Marketing strategies,"With more mechanised and designer home decor, these traditional durries are becoming extremely difficult to market. One, there are cheap imitations in the market and secondly, the price of raw materials has increased resulting in an increase in the cost of the durrie. With the transition of their market, from being the sole sellers to selling to the local community, the Khan family has also changed their product line and its corresponding ways of marketing. There was a time when Jamaluddin would visit local fairs and melas in Balotra, Pushkar and Jodhpur to sell the shawls and dhurries. And until 2000, he worked with the Shyam Ahuja Company, beginning in 1995.
Currently,  they are selling to Baba Arts in Ghanta Ghar, Jodhpur. And with their association with EPHC and DC Handicrafts, they managed to participate in exhibitions. Although previously they have worked with exporters but unfortunately, right now they are out of orders.
",Skill Development,"As a part of the growing craft industry, the Khan’s find it essential to revamp their skill sets and learn new ways to promote their craft. Hasam, Jamaluddin’s son expresses his wish to learn about customer service skills and marketing skills to expand his business. He is also keen on acquiring knowledge of access to online platforms to find new customers. He states that the online business model would allow him to stay at home and continue to work on his durries along with his father while acquiring a new clientel. 
Hasam’s vision for his family business is to expand his traditional artwork through institutional agencies and for that purpose he would like to participate in more fairs around the country. He wants to create a product that is sustainable, attainable and available to all.

","Jamaluddin Khan, 61, is a durry weaver from Salawas, Jodhpur. With a working experience of more than 45 years, Khan and has been immersed in the field of crafts since early childhood. He learnt the craft of durry weaving from his grandfather and father. Before durry weaving, his father, Nainu Khan and grandfather, Fazal Khan were engaged in block printing, but ended up durry weaving due to the scarcity of water in the area and the need to earn a living. 

Today, he and his son work together to produce varieties of durries, including jute, cotton and wool. Though they are proud to continue practicing their craft, they are still involved in agriculture for 3-4 months of the year. Farming, however, is just a mode of extra income for him. Alongwith durries, they have also ventured into making smaller handwoven utility items like hand bags, that sell easier.

JD-SD,JD-SD-02,Kesaram Prajapat,,Social symbolism of the durry,"Durries of Salawas have been a manifestation of the cultural symbols and growth of the community. Along with being a source of income for the community, the durries of Salawas had a significant role to play in social customs in the community, including marriages. A tradition that continues to be followed by the Rabaris, Prajapat and Jats of the village is that every girl would get a durry as part of her marriage trousseau. In Prajapat’s father’s time they worked with locally sources camel, sheep and goat hair, called Jhat. The Prajapat community got into this line of work because they were unable to make ends meet by making pottery and farming activities were only viable for 4 months in the year. What began as a means of survival for most of the community, is now their symbol of recognition. 

",External market influence,"20 years ago most of the durry artisans in Salawas were working with Shyam Ahuja and the business received from that one retailer was highly lucrative. There was no market for Jhat Patti, the ancient name and technique of durry weaving in the local market – they were dependent on the Iraq market for sales. In the 1980’s the demand for Jhat patti from Iraq finished and this was quite devastating for Salawas weavers. Shyam Ahuja came to Salawas in 1972 and got durrys made here till about 1986. In mid 1980’s the market for cotton woven durrys was created by Shyam Ahuja company and FabIndia. The new producted created by Shyam Ahuja had a very good market and this encouraged other traders to come to Salawas and place orders.
",Customer evolution,"In the past his father and grand father would weave durrys and keep them at home. The customers from different communities would visit them at home to buy the durrys. The Rabari’s would come to the home of the weavers with handspun yarn – they would pay the weavers the weaving cost and take away ready durrys. His customers included Jats, Chaudhary and Rajputs. Now these communities do not seem to want these durrys. The markets are very down at present. Kesharam is working with Bangla Natak Dot com and UNESCO. He has been to exhibition organised by them – Delhi, Kolkatta, Chennai, Goa and Jaipur. He sold very well and also got many orders. They also designed new sizes and products. This year his turn over has been 50000 rupees.
",Product diversification,"Kesaram ji has been invested in weaving durries since a tender age. However, his growth and expansion in the market can be credited to his ability to match up to the latest demands and innovations in the field. He has been able to find alternatives for the challenges faced in producing and creating a market for the conventional durrys. One such solution is the manufacturing of smaller durrys as per the customer’ interest and viability. He has also began venturing into products other than durrys, including table mats and table runners. Bags are another product variation – his son Rajuram takes care of the finishing and tailoring of these products. 

","Kesaram Prajapat, 66, is a durry weaver from Salawas, Jodhpur. A third generation artisan, Kesaram works with his son, Raju Ram and his family. Trained under his father, Alla Ram, Kesaram was encouraged to learn the craft at a tender age. He learnt to make durries using cotton yarn from Shyam Ahuja’s company who came to Salawas in the 80’s and provided Kesharam yarn and a few design inspirations. Post that, he received repeat orders from them. 
Kesaram is currently working with Bangla Natak Dot com and UNESCO. Along with participating in several exhibitions organised by them in Delhi, Kolkatta, Chennai, Goa and Jaipur, he has been able to expand the market size for his products. He is an avid propagator of innovation. Despite his lack of education, he learnt to read graphs to translate them in the durries. And now he has adapted with the changing market by innovating with his products, including making bags and smaller durries that sell easily.

JD-SD,JD-SD-03,Malaram Mundel,,Awards and recognitions,"Malaram ji’s 3 decade long journey has served him well. His ventures in innovation, strengthening his market reach, and zeal to exhibit his craft has earned him several accolades in the industry. His hardwork has been acknowledged by several institutions like FDDI and NIFT, where he has been a regular presenter. Malaram Ji has also been given the Rajiv Gandhi award, and several district awards by regional authorities. His efforts have been recognized by organizations like the Development Comissioner of Handicrafts, Ministry of textiles, Government of India. Despite these accolades, Malaram ji has been adamant on rediscovering his craft and making it viable. He hence participated in several marketing workshops and skill development training sessions, to empower himself and further his growth.
",Market shifts over the years,"There was a strong local market for the durry in the time of Malaram’s grandfather and father. Unfortunately, now they have to look for external markets. He proudly claims that he has over 100 durries in stock that he can sell. Shyam Ahuja, was the sole big buyer in this region in the 1990’s. FabIndia also sourced from Salawas but has stopped buying from this village in the past 15 years. FabIndia has moved its orders to UP as they say that the cost of production is too high in Salawas. The present customers are only tourists. Though Malaram Ji is connected to hotels and guides who bring the tourists directly to his home, he does not rely on them completely. He participates in the regular festivals and exhibitions organised by Bangla Natak Dot com. NIFT has developed an online market place for him and he receives a few orders regularly from this site. 
",Challenges,"Over the years, Malaram Ji has witnessed several tough times. His resilience through them all have been condemdable. On the professional front, his lowest point was when Shyam Ahuja and FabIndia stopped purchasing their products. With a hope to reconnect with them, Malaram Ji is still looking for ways to mend. This did cause a financial crunch for him, but not as much as the impact of GST on the cost of yarn. The impact, though secondary, but was enough to prompt a setting up of  a yarn bank and a common facility centre in the village as a permanent solution. Along with that illiteracy becomes a barrier in expanding his business and market. His family has equally suffered with sight related problems and the Covid-19 crisis resulted in expanding health and financial problems.",Community building,"There are about 25 families of durry weavers remaining in Salawas. Most of these weavers belong to the Prajapat community. About 20 years ago there were 200 weaver families making a living from durry weaving. Though the community of weaving practitioners is gradually shrinking, the community itself is very supportive of each other. There is a samiti/ association for the well-being and facilitating economic gains for the community, but unfortunately, but they are unable to function effectively. Malaram ji feels if there was more unity they could place bulk orders of yarn and purchase at whole sale rates. He blames the traders for the lack of unity, but he strives to create it someday and flourish in its benefits.
","Malaram Mundel, 44, is a durry weaver from Salawas, Jodhpur. He is a fourth generation durry weaver, trained under his grandfather and father, Pukhraj Mundel. His two sons, Ratan Lal and Chena Ram are also durry weavers. While Ratan Lal works with him, Chena Ram works as a weaving instructor at NIFT Chennai. Malaram started working as a full-time artisan at the age of 12 years. With the support of his family, he collaborated with Shyam Ahuja. Ahuja acted as a catalyst for Mundel, to learn new designs and taught him to work with cotton yarn. 

Malaram presently works with NIFT and is very happy to create new designs and implement new idea. His exhibitions in FDDI and NIFT have gained him the much deserved success. Along with that, his list of achievements include district, state and a variety of regional recognitions.

JD-SD,JD-SD-04,Babu Lal Prajapat,,Legends and community beliefs,"The Prajapats believe that they are descendents of Shriya Devi, who is said to have been a potter and a saviour of humankind. Every year there in the Hindu month on Magh there is a procession in the respect of Shriyadevi. The temple in Salawas dedicated to Chaumunda Mata also known as Hinglaj Mata or Thandi Mata, the goddess from Salawas predates the famous Mehrangarh fort. Its auspiciousness is such that the fortress was made to be blessed by the temple. The flame of the temple has been taken to Mehrangrah fort and established there, making the residents of Salawas important contributors to the ritualistic traditions of the royal family and the city. 
",Business expansion plans,"Babu Lal Ji believes in keeping up with the times and updating himself in the market. For the same, he would like to develop his skills in designing, marketing, understanding customers and the use of online platforms. He believes that to stay relevant he needs regular updates of changing market trends and customer needs. He would like to improve his understanding of new designs, for example he says that Bangla Natak advised him to reduce the size of the durry, he says this was excellent advice and it really increased the sale of his products. His product diversification, including bags, home decor products and smaller carpets that can be easily bought and used by all, have enabled him to improvise on his craft while keeping him relevant in the market.
",Family legacy,"Brothers, Bhawarlal and Babu Lal learnt the craft from their father and grandfather at a very young age. While they do not recollect when they started working exactly, since the learning was so seamless, what they do remember is that the interest in the craft was mutual. They would work on their father’s loom every day after coming home from school and college. With full support from the family, the brother’s inherited interest, craftsmanship, skill set and technical and creative knowledge, together. The family encouraged them to get an education and learn the craft of weaving simultaneously. Their business partnership has been successful solely because of their personal unity.

",Recent Challenges,"Markets for durrys have been reducing rapidly because of availability of cheaper alternatives in the market. At the same time, customers have very little awareness about the hard work it takes to make a durry which makes it difficult for them to differentiate between handmade and machine made durry. Inorder to expand the business, the weavers require financial capital. And regional banks do not prove to be very helpful in this case, for which reason they have to pick up money from the market at very high interest rates. This causes big problems for preparing stock for exhibitions. With low profit margins and the recent pandemic, the situation has gotten worse for these weavers. 
","Babu Lal Prajapat, 42, is a durry weaver from Salawas, Jodhpur. Babu Lal and his elder brother Bhawar Lal, both started working under their father, Umeda Ram at very young ages. His family encouraged him to get an education and learn the craft of weaving at the same time. Along with his brother, he has participated in several exhibitions all across the country and has also delivered training to students at NIFT and women artisans.
He believes that inorder to stay relevant, he needs to constantly update himself and his craft with alignment to the changing market trends and customer needs. He would like to improve his understanding of new designs, like how Bangla Natak advised him to reduce the size of the durry which proved to be an excellent advice that increased the sale of his products. With the assistance of organizations like DC Handicrafts, his vision to make Salawas a tourist hub is an ongoing project.

JD-SD,JD-SD-05,Lala Ram Prajapat,,Raw material accession,"Lala Ram Ji started working at a tender age, and made Jhat patti as a young artisan. At that time, they would buy yarn from the Rabari community and sell the durry back to them. Till the, the camel and sheep hair procured from the community, had a cyclic mechanism to reach it optimum valuation. Market expansions, especially the intervention of Shyam Ahuja brought about change in raw material – they started using cotton yarn. Now, they would receive the yarn from the company – weave the rug and receive wages for their weaving.

Similarly, he and his family is currently also the flagbearer of creating legacies and familial inheritances. Though his children are not a part of the sector, his grandchildren have taken keen interest in the craft.

Their interest and inclination towards the craft has prompted Lala Ram ji to continue and expand on his durry business. He sees a ray of hope for the future of his skill in his grankid’s future.
",Product uniqueness,"Lala Ram Ji is a proud durry weaver and while narrating the uniqueness of the durries made in Salawas, he says how this variant of durry is made only in this region. The Salawas durry, also known as Panja durry, as it is beaten by a tool called panja, derives it sturdiness also from use of that tool. Lala Ram Ji explains how the durry does not stretch, is agile, but also long-lasting. The techniques used while preparing it lend the yarns the robustness due to which they do not tear even after 25 years of use.
",Intra-community disparities,"Despite the fact that the Salawas village used to work as a single unit in producing durrys previously, today, the market competition and difference in technical knowledge have created the disparities between artisans. As Lala Ram Ji explains that each of the artisan has a different trader from where they get the raw material, depending on their individual designs. Individual preferences, beliefs, state of market, and associations influence the craft decisions that each artisan takes, each in the best of their own benefits. The community continues to work in unison and benefit mutually, but at an individual level, their mechanisms of growth differ widely. 
","Lala Ram Prajpat, 64, is a durry weaver from Salawas, Jodhpur. At the age of 25, he became a full time durry weaver and worked over 12 hours a day to earn a living for his family. Lala Ram Ji’s craft has been a gift to him, passed on by his grandfather, a potter and his father, a weaver. Alternatively, he also worked as a daily wage labourer to supplement his income.
But it was with the coming of Shyam Ahuja and his team to Salawas that Lala Ram Ji honed his skills. Unfortunately, his sons haven’t continued his legacy, but he is keen to pass on the tradition to his grandkids. Prajapati’s experience translates in his work. Pre-covid, he had collaborations with Bangla Natak Dot com and participated in several exhibitions.
