Respected Jakir Hussain,

Is awarded the first prize for his distinguished expertise in the Taj Mahal art, under the District Level Handicrafts Competition.

Signed,
District Collector
Jodhpur

A product of Jakir Hussain’s artistic talent, vision, and, skill – this Taj Mahal model is an exquisitely handcrafted piece carved from Bone & Horn. This masterpiece showcased Hussain’s exceptional capability and artistic skill in the art-form, leading him to win the handicraft district award for the same in 2002. The model does not have a price tag, for its enamoured beauty stands solely for the eyes of its spectators. 

The laborious process took the master artisan 2 entire years to finish. The model uses the popular yet painstaking style of bone-inlay: with each intricately carved bone piece made to fit into the mouldings on the wooden base. The model stands at around 36x36 inches and carries a weight of about 25 kgs. The replica is gilded with colourful traditional motifs such as the pietra dura, engraved with natural forms, motifs, and miniature human forms around the structure.

JD-BH,JD-BH-Mystical-02,Art Influences on the craft,,"Bone and horn craftsmanship has existed in India for over 4000 years and thus carries within it a rich history. Influences in the designs can be seen from nature, Rajasthani & Mughal miniature art, mythological characters and folklores of the state. Floral motifs, animals, traditional ornamentation, mosaic designs, and geometric patterns are abundant. Western influences on the artform can also be seen in the abstract patterns but are supplemented with a traditional touch. Common objects within the Jodhpur cluster include various boxes, jewellery, trays, and furniture.

The uniqueness of the products is attributed to the individual artisan and the centuries long history of the artform.

JD-BH,JD-BH-Mystical-03,Next step in business,,"The importance given to refinement and innovation in craft is essential. Also essential is to retain the craft legacy and generate economic employment within the cluster in order to ensure its continuity. Laxmi Crafts, led by Mr. Kamal Kishor Soni, took one such step through starting the export of their own goods. Granted by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry in 2012, the organization was issued the Importer-Exporter Code which enables the artisan to directly engage with the global market.

With his wide range of products such as jewellery, bags, and decorative household items that meet the demands of a variety of consumers, Mr. Soni has utilized his skill and vision to reach a much wider consumer base.

JD-BH,JD-BH-Mystical-04,A sustainable craft,,"Upcycling might seem like a recent trend, however the Bone and Horn artistry has been an upcycling industry ever since its inception. The raw material sourced for the craft is procured from the bones of naturally deceased animals that come from a government run agency or legal slaughterhouse in regions of Uttar Pradesh. In the most sustainable fashion, the craft is curated from ""waste"" leftover in nature. Additionally, they do not contribute to the sizeable increase in non-renewable waste landfills, due to their inherent biodegradable quality. 
Bone, in itself, is a material which is not susceptible to rotting or other issues that might come with organic substances, and thus ensures the final products are both durable and eco-friendly.

JD-BH,JD-BH-Mystical-05,A labour of love,,"An exquisitely handcrafted piece, this centre table is a result of bone and horn artisan, Mr. Jakir Hussain's vision and hard-work. It was created between 2019-2021 during the COVID lockdown. The exquisite table is adorned with boards of ancient gams such as Chess and Pacchisi and comes with in-built drawers that house each game. The games are fully playable with all elements included.
While usually colour-work in bone and horn is done with a single colour as a time, in this table Mr. Hussain painstakingly filled each nook & corner with a different hue.

The table weighs a whooping 100 kgs and is 54 inches in length and 34 inches in width. It is made using bone as the primary material with wood as the secondary. A pale yellow and gold base enhanced with a multiplicity of colours, the table is engraved throughout and also showcases a of miniature paintings. It is an exclusive piece that will not be put up for sale. The craftsman would prefer it to be showcased in a museum to put the intricate beauty on display for public viewing. However in commercial value, the table would cost no less than 5 lakhs rupees.
"
JD-BH,JD-BH-Mystical-06,Raw Materials,,"The raw materials used in the process can be traced back to the 1st century BCE, patronized by wealthy ruling authorities. Bone and horn craftsmanship is unique in its ways of procurement as well as its usage in the craft. These mini pieces of gems are procured in Jodhpur from Moradabad, Uttar Pradesh- Sambal and Barabanki, some parts of Kolkata and Udaipur. They come from the bones of naturally deceased animals – no animals are harmed in the process. The environment friendly industry flourishes in Sambhal, wherein the entire village has become specialised in the art of cleaning and cutting the bones. "
JD-BH,JD-BH-Mystical-07,A canvas of colours,,"These vases, provide a glimpse into the hue of colours used throughout the bone and horn cluster in Jodhpur. Hand-painting is prevalent across the industry and some commonly seen influences include floral & animal motifs and Rajasthani style miniatures. The colours mostly noticed are yellow, green, red, white and blue, with a recent increase popularity of black & white geometric designs. 

Categorized as vintage in the markets, bone and horn products have retained their authenticity and culture throughout their art. 
"
JD-BH,JD-BH-Mystical-08,User centric design,,"These bracelets of pure bone, are a signature variety of jewellery crafted by Mr. Kamal Kishor Soni. Made of brass and inlaid stone work, these statement pieces take about 20 days to be crafted and produced as finished products. Although mostly white, they are available in multiple colours and are also often finished with splash of rainbow over the white. Weighing not more than 100 gms and about 0.5 inches in width, the bangles and bracelets come in a variety of sizes. 

Once coloured, many of them are hand-painted with miniature floral & nature-inspired motifs or references from the Rajasthani school of miniature paintings. These bracelets were an innovation done by Mr. Soni as he assessed the market feedback from his various exhibitions.

As a representative of Rajasthan’s cultural heritage, the craft of bone and horn is a standout example of workmanship, design influence and the craft material as well as the technique used.

JD-BH,JD-BH-Mystical-10,Luxury to utility,,"While bone and horn is primarily considered a medium for luxury and aesthetically appealing products, they have recently also been put into use of making utilitarian products, such as this pencil box. A daily use item, by any student, can be also used as a cutlery box, a jewellery throve or a home décor product. The surreal colour combination of white and teal gives a radiant look to the piece. With floral motifs, the piece is further enhanced as an enchanted forest.
This product by Imammudin comes in an array of variations, with similar textures, colours and shapes.

Adding an ethnic touch to the daily use items, Imammudin has been trying to bring his craft to the lives of the ordinary from its initial royal patronage and usage.
