JD-BH,JD-BH-01,Suresh Chauhan,,Continuing the family legacy,"The importance of family shines through in conversation with the Chauhan Brothers. Even today, Suresh, Lalit Kumar, and Hem Karan Chauhan work together in unison, in an organically mechanised fashion. Each of them has been working in the craft for over 30 years and credits their father, Chunni Lal Ji, a dedicated craftsman for 40+ years, for their skill. They say that following in their father’s footsteps, shifting to other businesses was never given a thought. That being said, the youngest brother, Hem Karan, did try his hand at mojari-making for a while in the '90s alongside his father. But his core passion soon seeped in and he gravitated back towards bone and horn. At one point, each of the brothers tried their hand at the mojari art but found the bone and horn craft more rewarding.",From the 70's to now,"Talking about the timeline of their journey as artisans & businessmen, the brothers took turns to relay the story. In the late 70s, their father, Chunni Lal Ji, first started the business as a bone & horn karigar and around 1989 the three brothers joined him in a professional capacity. Working from home, they started their artistry with products that had floral motif designs carved on Ivory and Sheep Horn. When ivory was banned, they had to change the practice to the new bone raw material. This transition was difficult and labour-intensive as it would take hours to complete a product, unlike ivory bone which was softer and easier to work on. Finally, in 2010, they purchased a factory, which is where they currently work out of. For a couple of years, they had employed a handful of artisans while the demand was good, but COVID hit them hard and now only the three brothers remain in the factory.",Intricacy in Design,"Training for the Chauhan brothers began at a tender age. They would come home from school and sit beside their father, Chunni Lal Ji, and attempt to make the designs he was a master at. They fondly recall getting hurt in the process but returning to perfect the art day after day. The brothers take pride in their creations and praise one another for the aesthetics and intricacy of the designs each of them comes up with. Their signature and most famous design is the Mughal Jaali pattern, a most delicate and meticulous style of carving octagonal and hexagonal patterns into the bone.",Two of their best work,"The Chauhan Brothers speak of 2 products they created that they are proudest of till date. One was a door that was commissioned by a middleman and took the brothers 3 months to make while working simultaneously all day. The door has a royal look as an outcome of the  intricate carving and painting work influenced from the lavish forts of Rajasthan, supplemented with their signature floral motifs and arches. Today, they say, their children have shown them similar doors selling for lacs of rupees in the online marketplace. This knowledge is both a source of pride and sadness for them as they too would like to tap into that market someday. They created another masterpiece during COVID, wherein they were left with more time on their hands due to a decrease in demand – a miniature of the Taj Mahal. A stunning replica that is mounted on a floor made of black & white checks."
JD-BH,JD-BH-02,Banwari Lal Dev,,Complexities of the art,"In the summer holidays at the young age of 15, Mr. Banwari Lal worked for no pay under expert craftsmen in a Jodhpur Bone & Horn factory. While his family was involved in farming activities, there was not enough land to cultivate for 5 brothers. Hence, he decided take a different path and learned the art of Bone & Horn. After 12 years of mastering his skill, he decided to start his own venture. Going about both his craft and his business with a calm and composed demeanour, Mr. Lal has only positive things to say about his journey. While narrating the complexities of working with bone pieces for first-timers, he explains that artists have a hard time cutting, smoothening, and shaping the raw material. Any first timer, would get a running nose, burning sensation in his eyes, and a fever at night. The body, he says, takes almost a week to adapt to the pungent smell produced during crafting of the pieces. In fact, one of the major hazards of their work is the chance of injury, which due to the sharp machinery and intricate designs, is a certainty in the beginning. Having laser sharp focus is the baseline requirement for a Bone & Horn karigar.",Adapting to changing markets,"When the need for innovation arises due to fluctuating demand, Mr. Lal has never been one to be rigid. He is constantly innovating and adapting his products as per the changing markets. He also utilised a minimum waste approach with a new line of photo frames. Created from scrapped teak wood left over from other products, these frames were embellished with floral carvings and then finished with different coloured resin poured into the patterns. These frames became best-sellers at several exhibitions and are now a domestic market favourite. Describing the evolution of his work, he explains how, over a decade, the demand for Bone & Horn products shifted entirely from gift items to home furniture. Now, the majority of his business comprises of furniture pieces such as shelves, tables, and drawers. While he still produces home décor items and smaller gifting items, he does so sparingly.",Exhibitions and Delhi Haat,"Mr. Banwari Lal was introduced to exhibitions, and the platform they could give his business, in 2014: when he got a chance to install a shop in an industrial fair and received a positive response from the invited exporters. He also recounts, with much fondness, his visit to the famous Dilli Haat Market of New Delhi. He exhibited there in 2016 through an “artisan card” issued by the Export Promotion Council for Handicrafts (EPCH). With the card, the artisans can set up stalls in exhibitions across the country free of cost. He then exhibited at various places and even got work from 3-4 factories in Jodhpur. The Dilli Haat trip in particular yielded much response in the 15 days he was displaying there. If given an opportunity or if his schedule would allow, he would be more than happy to display at Dilli Haat again. While COVID slowed down physical showcasing, he is optimistic that they will start again.",A collaborative mindset,"According to Mr. Banwari Lal, the survival of the craft is a cumulative of craft knowledge, sustenance of the community, external support, and transfer of knowledge to willing craftspeople. He does not shy away from sharing his knowledge and skill with others, rather encourages it. If anyone were to approach him to learn the art, he says he is always willing to teach them. He explains how he is not hesitant in collaborating with other craftsmen and believes in employing freelance karigars as and when the quantity demands it. His workshop comprises of both seasonal and permanent workers whom he has trained and employed in various capacities. “Agar bada order aata hai toh hum bahar se bhi kara dete hain” [translation: “If a big order comes, we are even okay to give it to an external artisan”]. His abundant positivity towards the community and the craft can be felt by all those around him."
JD-BH,JD-BH-03,Jakir Hussain,,The Artist,"Jakir Hussain’s pride is deeply tied to his art. His high level of mastery and skill in the bone and horn art form cannot be easily replicated in an assembly line. Honing his skill from a very young age, he was merely 10 years old when he began working as a polisher in an aluminium factory. Being a first-generation artisan, he learnt the skill by making his way up in the aluminium factory from polishing to grinding and eventually working on bone and horn materials. His family has always been his anchor and his mother even supported him financially when he first got started. Now, both his sons are actively involved in the trade and helping their father wherever possible. His work has been exhibited widely around the world, including in Italy, Iraq, Iran, and Dubai. His life and work are a testimony to how indomitable Indian artisans are; he has demonstrated this by finding solutions in the face of many obstacles ranging from social, economic, and material.",A craft community,"The craft community associated with Mr. Hussain is diverse and holistic. While currently there are only two workers with whom he is closely connected and who work under him, he shares many instances and stories where a multitude of workers from different communities had worked under him. The bond he shared with them was one of mutual respect and admiration. He enjoys imparting knowledge of the craft to others and his passion shines through his words. He fondly recalls training many NIFT, NID, and FDDI students who stayed in touch with him long after their engagement ended. He treats them and speaks of them like his extended family. Urging more and more people to spread knowledge on the craft, he is hellbent on preserving the legacy of the bone and horn industry.",Products of passion,"A craft is best engrained at a younger age, according to Ustad Hussain. He believes that crafting is a cognitive skill, and an adult would be a slower learner than a child. He himself began practising handiwork at the age of 10 and attributes this to his mastery of the art form. Although there are governmental restrictions on the involvement of children in the industry, Mr. Hussain encourages anyone willing to learn the art form, to lay their hands on it at a younger age. A style that he prides himself on is working on products made from pure bone, which is a skill that is much tougher to become proficient at. For Mr. Hussain his passion lies in the art and his designs rather than building a business, and his products showcase his expertise thoroughly. He has created multiple stand-out pieces such as a statement Table with multiple games that took him 2 years to complete, a Taj Mahal replica that took around 2-3 years to make, a Chess Set that he prides himself on, and a 10-foot Train that won him the National Award in 2011. These are but some pieces that are close to his heart and will never be sold.",National Award in 2011,"Mr. Hussain was awarded the highest civilan honour in India for his craft when he was given the National Award in 2011. The award was given to him for his artistry on a 10-foot train that took him between 2007 – 2011 to make. He recalls that he was sceptical and uncertain when he received a phone call saying that he will be given the National Award that year. It wasn’t until the letter arrived from the Ministry of Textiles, Govt. of India stating the date and event of his award that he was certain of the same. Describing the intricacy of the design, he explains how he painstakingly modelled the train to be as close to the real Darshan trains as possible. The model has wheels that are fully functional and actually move on the railways track that he built under it. The engine of the model is an exact replica of the actual engine that is used, and he has carved more than 100 miniature statues of passengers that are placed inside the showpiece, including the driver. He explains why he didn’t leave the model in its natural state of white, which is his signature, as it would eventually start to look old over the years and so to preserve and enhance its beauty he got miniature paintings done all around the train."
JD-BH,JD-BH-04,Kamal Kishor Soni,,Duplication in Art,"Mr. Soni has been practicing the craft of Bone and horn for more than 40 years. He comes from a lineage of craftsmen and had the full support of his family while entering the industry. He distinguishes between an artist and a businessman while talking about how secrecy in earlier times was helpful in retaining the integrity of the craft. Art is personal, for it’s an artist’s expression of himself and is one of his most prized possessions. Recounting his initial days, Mr. Soni narrates how artisans didn’t allow anyone to enter their workshop spaces, to protect their designs. However, today, he says, any sample that enters the market is easily copied. But he has a positive spin on the trend – he says, in a light-hearted manner that he feels proud if someone copies his work as imitation is a form of flattery. He is confident puts out that he is not afraid of competition, as he prefers to focus on his work rather than trouble himself with what others are doing. He favours individuality and innovation, and strives to better his art with each product.",A glimpse into his mind,"Talking about his journey and the industry, Mr. Soni recalls when he got started he worked alone and used to visit multiple factories to ask for work. Slowly, over the years as his production increased he hired more labour. While he feels that the importance and respect given to an artisan were higher in the years he started, he has noticed an upward trend occurring across the nation today. People are becoming more sensitive and appreciative of the intricacies of handicrafts, he believes. His most successful products have been smaller gifting items such as paintings and carved products, as well as his recent innovation of studded bangles. He is always open to trying new things, and once incorporated feedback from some businessmen to introduce more products with a wooden base. Doing so, impacted him positively as the response for the newer range received was good. One platform he stays away from, however, are exhibitions. Narrating an experience from around 1997, he says he went for an exhibition through ‘Vastra Mantralaya’ [Ministry of Textiles] to Kolkata. Additional stock had to be created prior to the event, and the exhibition ended up not being profitable as he did not sell most of his products. Since then, he’s never thought to put up a stall in any other such fair.",Sources of inspiration,"While the miniatures painted and embossed on the bone and horn artifacts derive their inspiration from Rajasthani and Mughal style of miniature paintings, Mr. Soni views young talent as a reservoir of design ingenuity. Designer students from institutions like NID and NIFT often come to him for training and they bring with them their vivid worldview and creative minds. Mr. Soni says that as soon as their zeal to learn and theoretical know-how is put to practical use, the results are very rewarding. The designs are unique and fresh; giving him exposure to newer designs as an artist. He does not levy any economic charges from these training sessions, rather, for him, it is a healthy exchange of ideas, a platform for reflection, and a communicative process between artisans of similar fields. This exchange of abilities reflects in the products that Mr. Soni brings to the market.",Workers like family,"Mr. Soni believes in maintaining long-term relationships with his workers and treats them as his own family. He acknowledges the hard work that each worker puts in for they work a daily of 8-10 hours in the factory. He wishes them success and does not come in the way of their learning or growth. If a worker wishes to pursue an individual path, he isn’t hesitant to let the worker go. To create any piece, collaboration with other skilled workers is necessary and thus contractual labourers are often part of the process: the end products demand woodcraft, metal work, and hand-painting mastery. This makes inter-communal knowledge exchange a common occurrence in the bone and horn industry. Mr. Soni explains that his workers come from diverse backgrounds, which facilitates cultural intermingling whilst stimulating a sense of belongingness and allegiance towards the craft."
JD-BH,JD-BH-06,Rahmat Ali,,Access to market,"Ali owes a lot of his market expansion to his collaboration and guidance under the Export Promotion Council for Handicrafts. The multiple exhibitions in Delhi organized by EPCH opened up windows for exporter collaborations and even training sessions. They have, needless to say, served as a large market for most of the bone and horn artisans. Recalling his experience, Ali cites spaces like the Hunar Art in Pragati Maidan, and ExpoMart in Noida, from his initial exhibit days. A regular clientele also came from the Chatta Chowk, Red Fort, and Sundernagar in New Delhi, both of which have initiated the production of a new product line like the bone embossed canes. Other small gifting items that find their place in the local market have been continuously produced ever since Ali started contributing to the business. Hoteliers, affluent classes and interior decorators constitute a large chunk of the local customer base. Except for a lull in the time frame of 2007-2008, Ali has been fairly satisfied with the economic growth and revenue generation means. According to him, the market has served him well, even during the pandemic.",People's perception towards the craft,"Through the years of his father and his time, Ali has observed a significant increase in the demand of the craft. He proudly recalls an expansion in the number of workers and space, which are significant markers of a blooming market which has led to product diversification. In most cases like the introduction of furniture in the industry has been an after-effect of branching customer demands. For consumers overseas, the craft is more alluring. However, in local markets, the demand may be lower, but craft understanding is much higher owing to relatability and cultural resemblance.",Alternative raw materials,"The creative industry thrives on alternative raw materials and mass produced manufactures that act are cheaper and less laborious. Such materials garner the attraction of new consumer bases, owing to their affordability. One such material that Ali often substitutes with bone is plastic sheet. He narrates how the demand for such substitutes also arises from the demand of the buyers, who demand similar textures and designs at lower costs. Ali doesn’t shy away from admitting that he does engage in the production of such items, but also realises that the demand for duplicate materials like plastic is selective. The life, strength and creativity of bone artefacts continues to stay favourable than its cheaper alternatives.",Mutual Trust building,"According to Ali, an artist’s true character is defined by the quality of their art produced. It is also what enables the artist to build contacts, garner recognition and create their own identity. The creative abilities of an artist help in spreading good word about them, which further lends credibility to the business the artist develops. Ali is affirmative about an artisan’s ability to build a business purely on the basis of their hard-work and creative abilities. And hence, he also believes in the an equivalent growth in the consumer base."
JD-BH,JD-BH-07,Haji Ibrahim Ali,,Growth in export business,"Ever since Ibrahim sahab started in the 80’s the market has been largely domestic, with a handful of exporters. Although exporting was not new, given the ivory industry had flourished with exports of jewelery, home decor items, and ivory inlaid artefacts, it was scarcely essential. With the domestic markets in Delhi, Jaipur and Bombay booming, the prerogative of the exporters was needless at the least. However, the face of the market changed in the 90’s and post that. As the demand grew and competition increased, costs fell severely. Showroom sales, and local markets were not enough to compensate for the artistry. Soon enough, Ibrahim and his cohorts resorted to exporter sales that converged their markets and opened an arena undiscovered. As for Ibrahim sahab, the export business has been serving well for the last 29 years. And, surprisingly, his collaboration tends to only one exporter for the last 3 decades. A relationship catered with trust, intra-communal respect and mutual economic benefit, Ibrahim sahab has enabled a business that ensures an annual turnover of a whooping 2 crores.",Coping with the ivory ban,"As a young artisan, Ali worked under the tutelage of the 5-6 big names of the industry of that time in Raikabagh. In his initial days, when ivory was available in the market, he tried his hand at inlay and finishing work. However, post the ban on ivory, the raw material was restricted to licensed traders, there were only a handful of them though. Traders from Sambal, Moradabad took it upon themselves to provide the artisans in Jodhpur with an alternative raw material. Ali fondly recalls Chotu Khan from Sambal, who brought with him both bone and shells with him. While shells proved to be a health hazard for many, bone was fairly adept. Ali narrates how Khan enabled him to switch from ivory to bone smoothly. The same technical knowledge, machinery used and creative avenues, for most artisans remained the same during this switch.",Segue into the craft,"Ibrahim Ali has been working in the bone and horn industry for almost 34 years now. His creative intellect and agility has been strong held throughout these years. However, the choice to join the industry wasn’t free will for Ali. Ali , recalls his childhood as one where education was prioritized. His forefathers from Sindh has been pastoralists since ages, but his father particularly wanted his children to practice a less laborious task, that would not require any physical strains. For most of Ali’s childhood, he aimed to join the government services. But as recession hit, due to lack of job opportunities, the family began to encourage their children to train in an artform. It was his father’s farsightedness that made Ali venture into alternate career options, finally landing in the bone and horn industry.",Future of the craft,"According to Ibrahim Ali, the future of bone and horn is booming. He is positive about the demand of bone and horn artefacts to increase in the coming years, in both the domestic and international market. Ali attributes this growth to the globally expanding economy and the recognition of handcrafted products worldwide. Ali recalls that he has been advised to change his profession several times in the last 30 years, owing to the fear of decreasing demand of handmade items. But his personal opinion differs. For him, the world is his market, and till the time humanity lives, the demand for his craft stays alive."
JD-BH,JD-BH-08,Immammudin,,Secrecy in artworks,"Imammudin sahab, unlike many artisans, does not advocate discreteness. He rather gives in to the inevitability of it, and utilizes the open market to his own profitability. His process, mechanics and art is open to viewers and learners. Sahab’s trust on his creativity and credibility is long drawn for him to be confident. Imammudin sahab recalling his experience with market fluidity and product copies says that there seems to be no predictability to such issues. It is an irreversible effect, for which neither the artist or the art itself is responsible, he very earnestly gives in to the destiny of an artist. Rather, suggests for all artists to take it up as an opportunity to rejuvenate themselves. While showrooms carry a sense of suspense for the buyer, public displays like exhibitions hardly create any confidentiality. With ample chances of duplication, the products of an artist are open to rip offs at such spaces. On the contrary, private sellers were more wary of duping, often for their own benefit, and went to an extent of no photography policy. However, as of today, quantity has preceded over quality, and it is rare to find singular unique pieces.",Changes in customer base,"The customer base for born and horn artefacts has been ever changing and transforming. In the 46 years of his professional journey, Imammudin Sahab has seen a range of consumer exposure. Recounting his experience, he narrates how international markets have always been more favourable than the domestic ones. The demand of decorative handmade items has been inflowing from the southern states of India, rather than the northern regions. The unfavourable market conditions may have emerged due to the taboos associated to the material of bone in several Indian cultures. In a series of product diversification, the artisans of the industry have hence identified these variations and created a target audience that remains loyal to them.",A community's craft,"For the art of bone and horn to flourish, there are several communities who potluck their skills and crafts. Each of this community has a different trajectory of growth and measure of involvement. Hwoever, one commonality between all, remains their communal identification through the generations. Imammuddin sahab recalls how the Sutars (wood workers) and bone and horn artisans share an intimate relation to produce bone artefacts. Communities, both local and migrated from the regions of Sindh and Pakistan, have been key members of the bone and horn craft community. Predefined professional identities (jati) have been instrumental in the creation and facilitation of these communities, especially in the Marwar region. Imammudin attributes these distinctions as favourable conditions for the creative industry flourishing in the state.",Design innovations through the years,"Designs and their experimentation on bone and horn artefacts remains limited in terms of actual implementation, given the quality of the raw material. According to Imammudin sahab, the innovation in patterns used and inlay techniques has not changed much over the years. Most bone and horn artisans use three types of wood, mango, sheesham and babool for carvings. The technique of inlay remains the same for all three. As a craft of Rajasthan, the artefacts do become symbols of Rajasthan’s cultural diversity. Motifs inspired from artwork of different regions of Barmer, Jaipur, Jodhpur and Udaipur become prominent design features for handicrafts. More than often, it is Imamuddin’s and his co-worker’s own imagination and the demand of the consumer that gives shape to design innovations."
